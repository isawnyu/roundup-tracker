<p>This printer was in use in Whitney's area until recently, so I'd expect we have a power cord for it somewhere. (I know there has been an issue of power access in Whitney's area, so maybe it is semi-permanently behind the furniture.) There is a 2nd (identical) printer in Dawn's work area - I've put it on the Library counter. The power cord is not plugged into it, but I'm guessing that Dawn would know where it is (?) Diane</p>
