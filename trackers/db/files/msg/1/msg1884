The Astrom library will be delivered tomorrow, May 4th at Noon.

I have been assured by Linda that the load out of the exhibit will be complete by them.

The shipper will bring the boxes into the building and stack them in the smaller gallery space.

I'll watch, but no dollies or labor will be required from ISAW.
