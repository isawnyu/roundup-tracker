<p>Unless I've missed something (that Christopher will spot) that's <br />everything except the A3 scanner, an uninterruptible power supply, and <br />software. My current running estimate on the software front is an <br />additional $3,000 or a bit less (then there's an annual $250 fee for SPSS).</p>
