closing ticket now per marc's reply - pasted below

Tim,

These are all the options we are currently aware off. We will have to reach
out to the vendors help desk to resolve it.

On the upside, this error will not cause any problems at this moment since
the Planning web site can be used as an alternative. Furthermore, until the
middle and end of May, we are not actively using the Planning system and the
Essbase connection should suffice for any data retrieval if Suzan wants to
do that.

This will give us a little bit of time to investigate the issue with
Oracle's tech support.

Regards,
 
Marc
