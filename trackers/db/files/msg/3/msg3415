I don't know if this is the same error or not. I am getting message "The server responded with an error. Access to account "irene Gelbord " is not permitted. The server responded: "HTTP:/1.1 403 Forbidden" to operation. CalDAVAccountRefreshQueueableOperation." Choice is to Go Offline or Ignore

I have just come into the office and have not touched the machine since last evening. I am going to follow these directions, but am documenting what's on the screen first, just in case.
