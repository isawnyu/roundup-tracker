specific problems:
1. Sometimes I am able to login to the network as normal, but more often I get a message about roaming profile.

2. Once logged in, I cannot connect to Aleph.

3. Other librarians cannot log to network at all - do not even get the roaming profile message.

Please let me know if it will be helpful for you to have the error messages verbatim.

Thanks,
Dawn
