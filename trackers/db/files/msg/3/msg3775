Hi Ben,

Will you be working during spring break?  The problem is that we also have to work around the use of the room when classes are in session.  It would be easier for me to find a mutually convenient time during spring break, when the room isn't in use for class.   Please let me know if that week would be possible.

thanks.
Karen
