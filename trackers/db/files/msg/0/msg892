Tim:

As per our discussion today, could you kindly delete the isawevents email --- so going forward there is only one general email for ISAW: isaw@nyu.edu

Both Kate and Jessica will be the individuals checking this account. Jessica will take note of all rsvp issues and requests to be added to our listserv; Kate will manage all questions/ concerns regarding academic events.

Also, as per our discussion, please allow Kate to send messages using the general ISAW address; the lists (both internal and affiliates) should recognize her as user / administrator.

Thank you,
Suzan
