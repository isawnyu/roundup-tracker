<p>Dear Tom.</p>
<p>I was unable to log in the page Diane forwarded to me about adding a <br />news item. After I typed log-in information, an error message "The page <br />isn't redirecting properly" showed.</p>
<p>Could you have the problem fixed? (By the way, no problem for me to log <br />in my general ISAW pages.)</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Lillian</p>
