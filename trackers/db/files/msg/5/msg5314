Per discussion with Diane and Tom on 7/7/11:

Rod will be arriving in late July (official start date 1 August). He does *not* have a netid, and may not have one by then, because of delays involving his visa. Therefore it will be necessary to communicate with him via his current email (roderickbcampbell@gmail.com) or other email to be provided by Kate.

I think that he already has an account on the ISAW website, but please double-check. He will need the other standard capabilities (printer/copier, laptop/desktop hookup, etc).

His desktop computer is already on order:
