Hi Mike, there is a screw in the doorplate of the 2nd floor door by the elevator leading to the kitchen hallway that is sticking out and prevents the door from closing by itself sometimes. Normally this wouldn't be a huge problem, but the door when the door doesn't shut all the way promptly it starts that annoying clicking sound which is quite loud when there is a lecture going on. Thanks!! Kate
