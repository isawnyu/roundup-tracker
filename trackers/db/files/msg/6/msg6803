<p>I'm not sure why caching was turned off in the central configuration but I turned it back on, it's possible I did this and forgot to turn it back on which is why you are currently having problems. It'll balance itself out shortly, you may notice that when you logout it still shows the edit bars and such for a couple of minutes.. that will be remedied soon as I don't have time to fix it right now.</p>
