Hi Christopher,

I got home and a whole new set of symptoms emerged:  flickering cursor and file names, a curious tom-tom like pulse from the body of the laptop, most software missing from directries, and some other stuff.  It is basically non functional, even after restart.

I can get into ISAW on the weekend, but I wonder if I can get into your office to retrieve a spare laptop before I leave town for two weeks on Sunday morning?
