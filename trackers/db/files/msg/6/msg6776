<p>Roger would like us to verify that faculty *can* publish anything in their own profile, CV, and personal folder areas, as well as pages about their research under "about" or "research" but not news items. It would appear that Alex at least currently has universal publish permissions, so we'll need to check and modify/pull back where necessary.</p>
