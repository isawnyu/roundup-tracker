<p>The scanner will be delivered before 5pm EDT tomorrow. I'll be at ISAW part of the day but will be leaving around 1pm or so. Hopefully the scanner arrives before 5pm. In the case that it doesn't I've spoken with Garfield and he'll leave it on the 3rd floor and we'll get around to installing and setting up Monday.</p>
