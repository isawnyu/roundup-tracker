I think that is valid, unfortunately the events dropdown is based on the sidebar sixfeetup built I suspect. Which means it will have to be programatically disabled. The events page itself is a hijack of the folder_view for events so we get a proper display.

In any event, back burner until I feel like i've made decent headway on the other items of concern. In the meantime i'd start thinking about what tickets are most important to you. When I reach web items again i'm going for the low hanging fruit to start.
