<p>Dear Tom,<br />perhaps this message should be a new ticket too ;-)</p>
<p>I've just opened a new ticket asking to update the amheida.org <br />&lt;http://amheida.org&gt; web site from the repository.<br />It seems that it has been successfully submitted but if I click on "Your <br />tickets" nothing appears, neither the new ticket nor the ones I've <br />submitted in the past.</p>
<p>Not a big problem as long as you got it; I just wanted to let you know.</p>
<p>Best,<br />Bruno</p>
