I'm going to try and attempt at using Julienne's old laptop as an in-between stop-gap measure. I have to fully set it up, download updates etc etc so I'm projecting having something halfway decent towards EOD Tuesday April 26, 2011. Unfortunately based on the schedule as stands I will not be able to commence website work most likely until the earliest afternoon, April 28, 2011.

Kate is going to take the laptop to the Apple store and we'll try to get some info on repair cost. Will update when we cross some bridges.
