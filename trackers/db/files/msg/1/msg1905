Tom,

We have a site license for Filemaker Pro 9.  The image can be found in the techgroup/software/applications/filemaker folder.

I've had trouble getting the authentication to work in the past, but I have also gotten it to work.  
The license agreement is saved as a PDF in the same folder.  The user name must be entered exactly as it is written.  

Please let me know by email if you have any trouble.  I'm going to close this ticket.

Thanks,
Michael
