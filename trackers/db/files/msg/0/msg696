this seems to be some major issue with plls 4 where the virtual disk gets corrupted.  I replaced your corrupted file with the original I keep a copy of on the server.  everything should be the same, but if you need any help changing settings let me know.  also, if there are any files that are stuck on the virtual machine let me know that as well.
