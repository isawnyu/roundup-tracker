Over the course of the past two days I've helped several people with erroneous items.

Upgraded Carolines ram in her Macbook
Setup Joan on TimeMachine
Helped Beate with her email
Nate had a very minor issue
Judith stopped to setup sometime next week.

I'm not going to create explicit tickets for these as even though they took time. I'm starting to lose track of tickets on the frontpage that have been entered and either deferred or are waiting on action.
