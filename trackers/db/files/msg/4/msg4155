I have gone into Options> Personal information and everything is as it should be with no superfluous contacts, "NYU" or otherwise. I will be very grateful if you would refer this to ITS ASAP. There are really two issues, no doubt interrelated: 1. My outgoing messages have "NYU" and not my name; 2. While I can now send via NYU when I'm at ISAW, I'm under the impression that I should also be able to show an NYU address for outgoing messages sent from home.
