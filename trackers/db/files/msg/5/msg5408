There are two problems. If I send an email from the gmail account the sender is "Irene Gelbord " and it should be from ISAW Registrar and from @nyu.edu. I tried to change the profile name and added the isaw.registrar@nyu.edu as an associated email but this has not fixed the problem. Is there a way to resolve this?
