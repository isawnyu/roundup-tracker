<p>My main concern with the glass top came to life yesterday. The hot water was spilled and before it could be wiped up, dripped over and under the side of the glass and onto the table. Luckily it was only a small amount and we were able to absorb the water by sticking a napkin between the glass and the table, but I am concerned about damaging the table in the long run if liquid gets underneath the glass. I think it would be worth investigating whether there is something that could go along the edge of the table to catch the drips like these.</p>
