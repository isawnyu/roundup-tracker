<p>Currently isaw.it@nyu.edu email responses should technically be fed back into the email system. Right now, these responses need to be manually appended to the ticket. Unfortunately isaw.it@nyu.edu is just an alias that is proxied to several people instead of an actual email address. NYU policy forbids having an email address that doesn't relate to an actual human being and aliases are the only thing we can use.</p>
<p>There is a way around this. One is to have a new address, something like postmaster@automaton.isaw.nyu.edu (this is long). What we would then do is setup postfix to accept email on automaton and add postmaster@automaton.isaw.nyu.edu to the isaw.it@nyu.edu alias. We'd simply keep the reply to on tickets as isaw.it@nyu.edu. So when email is responded to the ticket system would then be able to process it and apply the responses to the appropriate ticket. If it has nothing to do with the ticket system it'll discard it.</p>
<p>There are some caveats here that need to be explored. The main one being ITS shooting this whole thing down by simply refusing to add postmaster@automaton.isaw.nyu.edu. I'm not sure that would be likely but it's possible. The next caveat would be any policies regarding smtp's. Of course automaton is currently and has been sending email via postfix for the last 14 months. So I don't see any problems there.</p>
<p>Bumping to high deferred only because this is a cohesive issue.</p>
