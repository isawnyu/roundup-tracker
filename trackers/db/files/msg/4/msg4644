I am entering a new ticket for this since I do not see my earlier request.  In order to complete ISAW work while on an upcoming ISAW trip, I will need to bring my personal computer.  In order to complete the work, I will also need filemaker pro, which I do not have on my computer. Is it possible to install FMP on my computer  before I depart on May 12?
