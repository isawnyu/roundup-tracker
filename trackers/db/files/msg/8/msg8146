<p>There were a slew of updates for this machine that needed to be completed. This was just done, also there seemed to be an issue with the mouse again, it simply loses connection whenever it wants. After the latest update this seems to have stopped and there is nothing near this setup that would cause major interference. If it keeps happening we'll probably have to get a wired mouse in the interim but things seem to be ok here.</p>
