<p>Automaton needs another hard drive for backup. Realistically we cannot use a usb backup solution for this type of server machine. The problem is that in a real world scenario where there is a hard drive failure, there is no sufficient way to rebuild the system without a large amount of downtime. Having a raid setup becomes paramount because it not only decreases the downtime spent but the server has gained critical processes that would paralyze us.<br /><br />The recommendation is to order two 1TB hard drives and pair them in a RAID-Z configuration using something known as <a title="ZFS" href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/filesystems-zfs.html">ZFS</a>. There maybe some debate as to why ZFS but it's a robust filesystem that was invented by Sun before it was bought by Oracle. It's also fully support in FreeBSD proper and will be supported there into the foreseeable future.<br /><br />I should note that this is the backup strategy for this server and has nothing to do with the backup strategy for ISAW faculty and staff.&nbsp;</p>
