For the Levy lecture (Thursday, Nov. 4), I will need the following moved/set up. If this could get done Thursday morning (the 4th) so we disrupt normal operations as little as possible, that would be great.

Oak Library: Furniture pushed to sides of room, taken out as needed. Please also make sure the floor is clean and area dusted.

Lecture Hall: All chairs moved to Oak Library.

Foyer: Have folding table set up at bottom of staircase (not the really long one).

Please see me if you have any questions. Thanks! Kate
