My computer is set to perform automatic updates during my workday, at which point I have no option to "restart later" and must stop whatever I'm doing and restart. Is it possible to schedule these updates for after-work hours, or have a "restart later" option? I tried to change this myself but Windows says I need to have Administrator access to make those changes.
Thanks!
