<p>I need to find sometime to have this addressed properly, it's likely that we will need to get an access point on the 4th floor but i'd like to be sure that is the proper course. If there is something else going on as in a beam that is causing interference, or some other radio interference is being caused by a device or some other issue, i'd like to nip that in the bud first. Carlo sent me an email sometime ago about this saying that he couldn't see an issue from his end but I haven't followed up. This will take some triage.</p>
