<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>Will you ask Dwayne to clean the shelves that are located in the carrel area on the 3rd Floor?&nbsp; We just recently emptied the bookcases, and want to have the shelves cleaned before restocking the area.&nbsp; It will help our workflow, if the cleaning can be done by the middle of next week.&nbsp; If that is not a workable timeline, please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dawn</p>
