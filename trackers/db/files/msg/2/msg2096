Running some hardware test here if everything seems ok then I will run disk utility to ensure the hard drive is ok. From there we will clean and hopefully that will fix everything. In the event that it doesn't we will most likely need to reinstall osx for which I will just reinstall the system files which should keep your user installation around. If not we have backups.
