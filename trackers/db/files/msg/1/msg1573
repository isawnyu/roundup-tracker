Michael:

When you have a chance, please contact Whitney to get the latest copy of the ISAW directory (she\'s updating it now to include Christopher). When you\'ve got it, please replace the old one on the front page of the wiki with the new one. This should address Roger\'s earlier concerns about the content thereof.

Thanks,
Tom
