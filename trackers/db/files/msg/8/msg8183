<p>We heard back from RESNET here and things have been modified. So far I haven't heard many complaints but I will be walking through-out the building periodically to get a feel of whether this has become less problematic. The team downtown wants to go ahead and upgrade our wifi network and access points. The first round of work to be scheduled hasn't been announced and the current assumption is that the announcement will take place soon. I've asked that ISAW be slotted at the top of the list for these changes and modifications be made for the 1st and basement floors for extended coverage.</p>
<p>I'll update as this creeps forwards.</p>
