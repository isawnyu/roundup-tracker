<p>Even though Whitney was able to workaround the current crisis, this is an issue that needs addressing when next Christopher has time to turn to web stuff. Deferring for now, but keeping open.</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>I went ahead and rewrote the news item after Kate couldn't find it either. Oddly, once I saved the new item, the original was visible in the little navigation buttons on the bottom of the page even though it wasn't visible in any other view. I deleted it so there wasn't any confusion.</p>
