Hi Tom,
Thanks for your message.
The list that you provide above (Photoshop, Illustrator, AutoCAD, and Office-full version) is comprehensive. I would only add Acrobat Pro.
Until now, I have used only pc, but I am certainly happy to be provided with a Macintosh laptop. I would just need to make sure that the data and files that I have gathered and processed in and outside the field using a pc can be transferred and are readable using the same softwares but for Mac (I am particularly concerned about AutoCAD for Mac, since I have never used it).
Once again, many thanks!
Nico
