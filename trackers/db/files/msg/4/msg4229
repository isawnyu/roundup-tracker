Dear Victor,

This is what you see--&quot;NYU&quot; when I send using my judith.lerner@nyu.edu or jl3699@nyu.edu account. I have tried to enter as my preferred name &quot;Judith Lerner&quot; but it doesn't seem to take.

Many thanks for your help and confirming that my name doesn't appear in the &quot;From&quot; line but instead &quot;NYU&quot;!

Juidth

P.S.I just tried to send via NYU from my home--which I finally was able to do this morning--but now I can't. Hence the Earthlink.
