<p>I do not agree, i'm not sure how Tom feels. I'd rather not panic or employ methods that just waste time. The flaw that caused all this panic was do to a trojan which had to be installed via a website. Apple released an uninstall tool for the malware such that should one have come across this trojan it would of been removed. Oracle which releases Java will subsequently be updating versions of Java for OS X at the same time as all other major operating systems, to avoid this problem in the future. All of ISAW's Apple machines have been programmed to update automatically and are unaffected.</p>
<p>To date an actual Unix/Apple virus propogating in the wild is rare, contrary to what has been reported in the media there is a very big difference between a virus and a trojan. A virus is a digital form of the biological same, as in it'll infect any executable that it can find and spread itself. A trojan is based on a piece of software that employs methods or strategy similar to Odysseus to try and achieve some form of nefarious goal. What is being reported as a virus, is in actual fact a trojan. I'm not sure why the media can't seem to get this simple notion.</p>
<p>If the machines at ISAW were infected/hijacked or being used in any manner that is abnormal.. I will know as it is happening. If I miss it or am not available the NYU-NET dragnet usually quarantines the machine. This has happened a handful of times all of which were false alarms, with the exception of the library machines which are administered by their own team. All of our server machines receive random and targeted attacks daily to which I am very vigilant.</p>
<p>The Microsoft machines on the other hand I recommend downloading virus/trojan protection. Microsoft has recently released a malware tool but that doesn't seem to aid much. Lorenzo, Nico, Mike K, yourself, Library staff and machines all have virus protection software (with the exception of our book scanner which I hope to one day see work properly).</p>
