<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>How could it be that dpi has nothing to do with resolution? I don't<br />understand your explanation. The way I always understood resolution,<br />it is about number of dots per area, and the same scanner used to<br />produce much smaller files with the same dpi earlier when it was just<br />set up. The same thing happened to the scanner at IFA, the files where<br />reasonably small and recently it produces these big files.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Mehrnoush</p>
