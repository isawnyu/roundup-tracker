<p>Failure to lock would explain what Ellen calls pocket dial (i.e., accidental bumping of buttons), if that happened during the interval between putting the phone in the pocket and its own automatic self-locking, which happens pretty quickly. But I'm not sure it would explain the call from Ellen's phone to mine. I shall try careful locking and see if this recurs.</p>
