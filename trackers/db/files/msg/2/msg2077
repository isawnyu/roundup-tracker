Michael:

When you're back at work, please contact Sean (sean.gillies@gmail.com) to work out purchase and shipping of a 24" apple cinema monitor (or equivalent). The funds are to come from my "research account". I'll forward a copy of this ticket notification to Tiffany and to Sean when it comes through (copying you) so everybody knows what's going on.

Thanks,
Tom
