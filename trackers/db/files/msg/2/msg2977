Hi Whitney:

Thanks very much for bringing this to my attention. Kate opened a ticket about this (also evidently prompted by Kathy -- who is Kathy?) yesterday, and I've looked at the site in Firefox and IE from a PC running XP (as well as Safari, Firefox and Chrome on my Mac) and in all of them the umlaut is just fine.

I'm going to close this ticket. If you see Kathy, please ask her to email me directly if she has a further question about this.

Many thanks,
Tom
