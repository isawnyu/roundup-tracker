Ellen/Mike

I've contacted ITS on three different occasions and so has Ava in HR. Each time we reply, a different person receives my response.  Therefore, I'm asking Mike to resolve this issue through a more official IT channel.

Mike, as our IT person, could you kindly write directly to its.accounts@nyu.edu; please cc me and Ava Tseng and Marilyn McMillan on the message. Please explain that Ellen is a PAID faculty member at NYU and that this our fourth request; I will forward you a copy of her appointment letter tomorrow.

Ellen, when/if this comes up again in the future, please fill out a ticket b/c I do need a log of these issues. When these issues are caused by ITS, I want to send Roger the full list of each and every request we've made that has gone unanswered / unacknowledged.


Thanks,
Suzan
