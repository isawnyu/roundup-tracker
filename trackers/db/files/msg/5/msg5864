<p>I think I should take that last comment back.</p>
<p>I submitted&nbsp;<a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/Members/sebastian.heath-40nyu.edu/isaw-roman-pottery-reading-group">http://isaw.nyu.edu/Members/sebastian.heath-40nyu.edu/isaw-roman-pottery-reading-group</a>&nbsp;for review as a test. But I see no way to approve it so it's externally visible. I poked around but didn't find any checkbox, etc. Obviously that text isn't the final product so I'm not going to link to it until "done". I'm just interested in getting some momentum on it. Am I just missing some UI element?</p>
