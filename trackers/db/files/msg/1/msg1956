Mike:

I realize the pre-construction may not be complete, but I'd like to kindly ask that the second floor lecture hall be kept as cool as possible for a lecture on Tuesday, June 1st at 6 pm.

Kate Lawson / Whitney Steen will be handling the logistics of the lecture; Dr. Ann Macy Roth is scheduled to arrive at 5pm, so naturally, we hope the lecture hall is at a good temperature by the time she arrives.

Many thanks for your efforts, Mike.

best,
Suzan
