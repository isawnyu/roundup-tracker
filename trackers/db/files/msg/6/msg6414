<p>Now that calendar migration is behind us, I'd like to get to the issue I had postponed, replacing my 2007 Blackberry with an iPhone, I imagine 4S. Ordering one should be straightforward, but I need some help in determining what data plan to get with it. I'm sure I will use it more than I have my BB, because the latter handles the web so badly, but I still don't have any real idea of how much data I use in a month. My son thinks the smallest plan is probably most likely, since I don't do things like movies. Any experience on which to go? I will then probably need some help with setup, esp. calendar. But we'll see.</p>
