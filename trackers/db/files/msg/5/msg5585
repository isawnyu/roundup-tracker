<p>some ideas:</p>
<p>* define ISAW as an organization</p>
<p>* define ISAW people as members of that organization</p>
<p>* link ISAW people to their workplace homepages in the site, as well as other web resources they specify (via their profiles and CVs?) that are outside the site</p>
<p>* link ISAW as an organization to the other web resources it's involved in that are outside the site (e.g., facebook, twitter, other social media and our project sites, our google places page, etc.)</p>
