Hi Tom,

One urgent update and (un-urgent) a couple of things I've noticed. 

1. AIA has just informed us that their event tomorrow is actually going to start at 6:30pm (even though all their publications say 6pm).

2. Take down the faculty postings, the committee is going to review everything next month.

3. Remove Anna from the Clinical Faculty page.

4. Update the graduate program page to say 'We are no longer accepting applications for the 2010/11 academic year. The application process for 2011/12 will reopen in September'.

Thanks,

Kate
