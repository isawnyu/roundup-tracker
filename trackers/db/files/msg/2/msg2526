Hi Tom, the student application system is online again. Can we change the notice at the top to say: 

We are now accepting applications for the 2010/11 academic year. Please see the link at the bottom of the page to access the application.
Recommended due date: December 18, 2010
Final due date: January 4, 2011

Also, please change the year in the bottom paragraph of the page to say 2011-12.

Thanks!

Kate
