<p>The 4th floor wireless connectivity at ISAW is extremely weak and has been so for a little while. Martin Reznick first brought this issue to my attention last week but the quality of the signal hasn't changed. I've sent a message to&nbsp;<span>Carlo Cernivani as he has generally been helpful in the past.</span></p>
