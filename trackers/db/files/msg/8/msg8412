<p><span>After the long chat with Adobe support I have found out that the serial key we have on the cover of CS6 disk is of Acrobat X pro and not CS6 Design and Web Premium.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>I have installed CS5.5 Web and Premium on the arch station and it is working now. It can be used for sometime I guess till we have the serial key for CS6.&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Opened a new ticket to get License for Adobe CS6 Web and Premium. Closing this one.</p>
