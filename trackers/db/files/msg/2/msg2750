After checking all the windowsills on the 3rd floor, I have found four that need minor paint touchups.  The two windows in Elizabeth's office (309), the window in the cubicle area that is on the library side of the floor, and the window in the library directly under the stairs all have scratches or chips that need touching up.

Thanks,
Whitney
