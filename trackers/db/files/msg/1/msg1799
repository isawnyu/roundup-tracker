Dear Mike,

On Wednesday, April 14, 6:30-8:30, the exhibitions department is hosting a tour/reception for the Apollo Circle, Metropolitan Museum of Art. The reception will be in the Oak Library. They are expecting a maximum of 150 people. They are covering all costs including caterers and clean up. Roger is aware and has approved the event. 

Could the chairs and small side table please be removed from the Oak Library. We would also like to rearrange the two large couches to face the windows, as you have in the past for large events. 

Could we schedule a time to meet and review the details? Please let me know when is convenient for you.

Thanks,
Irene
