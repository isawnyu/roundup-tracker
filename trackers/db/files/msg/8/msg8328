<p>Well it's finally time to upgrade the iMac drives as Anshul and Monish have noted that they are failing rather consistently. &nbsp;Leaving them with no desktop machines, we also don't have any spares that are functioning properly.</p>
<p>We have three options:</p>
<p>1. Do it ourselves which is likely to be problematic at this point, as I don't have the resources to do this here, I don't even have a desk to put this stuff.<br />2. We have Apple do it, which is a better option but they weren't willing to give Anshul or Monish a price when we called. Also they will not install anything but Apple hard drives in the machines and generally that's just retarded at this point.<br />3. We have tekserve do it. I thought of them just now and gave them a call. It would be 160 USD per iMac to change all the 4 drives in the iMacs. That is just installation, we provide the drives.</p>
<p>I'd like to setup an appointment here so that they can all be repaired at exactly the same time, so about $640 USD + tax. The only thing now is where we charge this to? Also we'd need to configure transport for the 4 machines to be delivered. Whether Ansul or Monish take them over, there is no way they can walk Downtown with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How should we proceed here?</p>
