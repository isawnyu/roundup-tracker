I think it might be easier for users if we disabled showing the titles of individual events in the popup that shows when you hover over &quot;EVENTS&quot; in the main nav. They tend to be too long, and right now they're not properly ordered by date. I don't think it hurts people to go to the main events page. What do you think?
