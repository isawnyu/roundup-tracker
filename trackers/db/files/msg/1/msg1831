Hi

Yesterday, I couldn't connect to wireless at ISAW. I was asked for credentials. This is the second time that this happens to me. I don't know why. I am going to check it at ISAW around noon, but, if it doesn't work, I would be around until 2:30, and I would be thankful if somebody could check it.

bests,
