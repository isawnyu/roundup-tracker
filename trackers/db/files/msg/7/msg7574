<p>This drive is completely dead and will need to be recovered with most likely a new motor/platter etc.. You could try these guys:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.securedatarecovery.com/data-recovery-new-york.html">http://www.securedatarecovery.com/data-recovery-new-york.html</a>&nbsp;but I cannot vouch for them. If you'd like for me to handle it I won't be able to get to this until later next week.</p>
