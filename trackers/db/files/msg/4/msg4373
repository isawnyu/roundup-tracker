Downtown ITS Networks needs to perform an upgrade of our switches and components in the basement, the 3rd floor and the 5th floor. This will require close to an 8 hour window of complete downtime, which will interrupt internet/wifi/phone connections and will have to occur in parts. Due to the fact that the upcoming weekend is Easter for persons who observe it and they will need to breakup the work into two days. I'm thinking the best time to begin the work would be this upcoming Friday 4/22 finishing hopefully on the 23rd or the 24th.

Please let me know if this window works if not it will have to fall on the 25th or the following week which is also the first week May.
