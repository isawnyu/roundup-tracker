Hi Michael, 
I upgraded the operating system on my MacBook Pro fro Leopard to Snow Leopard and I am having some problems. I think they relate to programs that I have uninstalled but they do have not been uninstalled properly. There are some error messages that appear when I boot the laptop. I would be grateful if you could come around and have a look.
