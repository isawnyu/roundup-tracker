<p>Parallels is not accessible on my computer. I believe this is the same issue Tiffany was having after the upgrade to Lion (today is the first time I have tried to access Parallels since the upgrade).&nbsp; I know Chris is out, but I am putting in this ticket because it needs to be taken care of as soon as possible upon his return, unless there is an easy fix and someone can tell me how to do it now.</p>
