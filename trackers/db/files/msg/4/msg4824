The alarm went off at about 8:15 this morning. When we manually reset it from the panel, all lights went off and condition returned to normal. Just 5 min earlier I had verified that the trouble light was still on. We can close this ticket and I'm hoping the new switch installation in June might cure the cause (?). 
Thanks, Diane
