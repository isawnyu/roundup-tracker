<p>I am working with UDAR to set up the page on the NYU website. It will have 4 choices for donations which will link to the accounting system, so donations can be automatically dropped into accounts. Text is being drafted and the accounting side is being set up. The pacing item is currently the accounting piece. Estimate to completion for the NYU piece is 12/16.</p>
