Putting a call into Beatrice Richardson (who is on maternity leave.)  Library machine is having a connectivity issue - network is plugged in but no service.  Cynthia Guy at 2-9014  is covering for Beatrice and offered to send a library tech.  I have given the contact information to the librarians and invited them to contact me or them if they need to follow up.
