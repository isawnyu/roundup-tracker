Dear Mike,

For your information, the Exhibitions Department is giving a tour followed by a reception on Monday December 14. The tour will be in the galleries, 4-5 PM followed by a small reception in the Oak Library, 5-6 PM. It will be for about 15 people so no furniture needs to be removed. 

Thanks,
Irene
