Christopher: please make an appointment with Roger to figure out and correct what's wrong with the software install(s) on his MacBook. He writes:

&quot;I can't use Acrobat; it first demands a password, and then after that tells me that Acrobat was installed as part of a suite, so I have to start some other part of the suite, like Photoshop. But there is no sign of Photoshop on the machine (although there was supposed to be), and the only thing I can find at all relevant is a Creative Suite deinstaller, which isn't really very helpful.&quot;

I had him check the full applications folder and he reports:

&quot;the needed Photoshop (or other piece of CS) is not there. The Acrobat icon moved down into the tray [dock] when I clicked on it, but vanished after I was unable to satisfy the demand to open Photoshop.&quot;

Thanks, Tom
