Tim:

I'm having some serious trouble running Windows on my Mac at home; as you know, I've been working gradually on loading the budget onto Hyperion.

However, Vista keeps freezing on me and then shutting down. This is a bit frustrating especially when I've made progress and then find that my changes have been lost.

How can I install Windows XP on my parallels if I have XP already? Is it as simple as purchasing the license?

I"m just asking and there's no particular rush on this, but I would like to finish this Hyperion piece this year.

Thanks,
Suzan
