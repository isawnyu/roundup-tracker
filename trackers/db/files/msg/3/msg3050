Since my laptop crashed on the line of duty in Kazakhstan, I had to buy a new one. I will travel again to Kazakhstan for work on January 16th and I need to bring the laptop with me (hoping not to destroy it this time around). Therefore I need FileMaker pro to be installed before my departure.
I will be at work almost everyday this and next week. Let me know when is the best time for me to bring you the computer.
Thank you
Roberta
