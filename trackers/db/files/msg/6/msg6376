<p>I received this email from Judith Lerner (cc'd to Roger): I''m not sure how the publications page is set up/formatted, so let me know if/when this is possible.</p>
<p>Thanks, Kate</p>

<p>Hi Kate,<br /><br />I was just perusing the ISAW website and thinking that since the Journal of Inner Asian Art &amp; Archaeology is now published under ISAW's aegis, it should be included under "Publications" or mentioned somewhere on the site. I can write a paragraph or so describing its scope and contents, and of course include an image of its cover. Soon I plan to work with Sebastian to develop a "splash page" announcing our next volume (no. 5) with its ToC, the ToCs of previous volumes along with some images to present further its range of articles. Not only is it good publicity for the Journal, but is further evidence of ISAW's involvement with the cultures of Central Asia and China. &nbsp;<br /><br />Best,<br />Judith<br /><br /></p>
