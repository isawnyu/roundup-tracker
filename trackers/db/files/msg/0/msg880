Hi Tim. I think best to deal with the desktop for my office first. So
please do purchase the 24&quot; iMac, as per your recommendation. Following
Suzan's email below I understand the first $1199 of the cost comes from
ISAW's general fund (as do MS Office and Acrobat Reader), and the
remaining difference from my personal research account. I'll think more
about particular software once I'm in residence, and I'll also think about
a laptop closer to September. Many thanks, David.
