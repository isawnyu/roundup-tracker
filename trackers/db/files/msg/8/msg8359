<p>I have ordered 2 licenses for Harris Matrix Composer. This will permit installation on the "informatic station" in 603 and also on laptops used by Lorenzo and Nico (one laptop each). Any other installations will require purchase of additional licenses.</p>
<p>IT team: please download an installation image from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.harrismatrixcomposer.com/harris/">http://www.harrismatrixcomposer.com/harris/</a>&nbsp;and go ahead and do the installation (coordinate with Lorenzo and Nico to get it installed&nbsp;on their laptops). As soon as I receive the licenses, I'll provide these and that will unlock the limited free trial.</p>
<p>I'm leaving the ticket assigned to me so whoever (Anshul or Monish) picks it up can do the reassignment. Taking Diane off the cc list since there are no longer facilities issues associated with this ticket.</p>
