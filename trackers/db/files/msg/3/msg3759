Hi Mike,

Dwayne can begin disposing/recycling of the boxes of pamphlets outside the Library glass on the 4th floor.

I realize that they cannot go out all at the same time, and that he'll have to take one or two at a time until they are gone.

If you and he need me to show you exactly which ones I mean, I'll be happy to do so.

Thanks.
