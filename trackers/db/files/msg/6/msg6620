<p>There has been a foul smell in the building since yesterday. I was hoping the air exchange would clear it overnight. The entire Stair A has the smell, so it is througout the building. Can we increase the air exchanger to cycle it out?</p>
<p>I know the air intake is on the roof, but this smell is not outside the building (front or east side).</p>
