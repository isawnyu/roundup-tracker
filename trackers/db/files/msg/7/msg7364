<p>See below. This is all I know about the process. If you need further help with authentication, please follow the instructions Meredith gave below for contacting Autodesk customer service. Let us know when you get the matter resolved.</p>
<p>Best,<br />Tom</p>

<p>Tom -- Thank you for the reminder.</p>
<p>*Nicola and Alexander* --</p>
<p>I have requested accounts for you. They may take up to two hours to be <br />created. Once they are, you should receive an email from Autodesk that <br />you can log in to subscription.autodesk.com <br />&lt;http://subscription.autodesk.com&gt; From there you should be able to <br />download the Autodesk Master Suite.</p>
<p>To authorize and authenticate the software, you will need to enter the <br />serial number and product key:</p>
<p>Serial Key: 361-56301128<br />Product Key: 651D1</p>
<p>If, for some reason, these do not work. The system will give you a <br />registration code (or similar). You can call Autodesk's customer <br />support with that code, the serial number, product key, and indicate you <br />are with NYU; and they will work with you to get the installation <br />authorized.</p>
<p>Autodesk's customer support can be reached at 800-551-1490.</p>
<p>Best, Meredith</p>
