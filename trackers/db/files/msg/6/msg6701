<p>Diane:</p>
<p>The new website is designed to allow faculty members to make changes like this themselves, or Kate can do it for them. My team is not staffed to do piecemeal changes to website content that are fully supported by the over-the-web editing capabilities of our platform. If Lorenzo or Kate need training or run into trouble, then they should open tickets accordingly.</p>
<p>I'm closing this ticket with status "wontfix".</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
