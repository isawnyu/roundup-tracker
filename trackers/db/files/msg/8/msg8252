<p>Mike,</p>
<p>I've been working in the library as part of the Open House NY this weekend. Yesterday it was warm, but today it seems even warmer: the upper 70s here on the 3rd floor and warmer on the upper floors. Could you please check it on the BMS? (If it is in bounds, I am not asking that you change anything.)</p>
<p>Thanks, Diane</p>
