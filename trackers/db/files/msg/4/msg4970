Pasting email exchange from last week here:

Seems fine to me, that's Plone's default mechanism. What I suspect is that with all of the moving data over from Plone Alpha 4, 4a1 etc etc etc I just made a folder to house all news content objects without having to worry about Migration.

Open a ticket and next time I visit website items i'll take care of it.

    What do you think about this proposal:

    1. Delete the link http://isaw.nyu.edu/news

    2. Move the collection I just created at http://isaw.nyu.edu/Members/tom.elliott-40nyu.edu/news from its current location to http://isaw.nyu.edu/news

    3. Link the &quot;Latest News&quot; header in the sliding magic box on the home page to http://isaw.nyu.edu/news instead of http://isaw.nyu.edu/about/news

    Rationale: give visitors to the site access to the complete history of our news items in a paged way that's also ordered by effective date without us having to do any manual reordering of content (not sustainable). Compare the view of http://isaw.nyu.edu/about/news

    Alternatively, we could modify (template modifications?) the display of http://isaw.nyu.edu/about/news to do what I'm suggesting.

    Thoughts?
