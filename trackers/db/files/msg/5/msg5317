Hello. I need Microsoft Word for my computer. I currently have only the Microsoft Starter version. In this version I cannot add footnotes to a text, which is a very serious problem for me. What software do I need to purchase, and can the Computer Store downtown--or anyone else for that matter--help me install it? I'll certainly need that help. Please tell me what I should do as soon as possible.
