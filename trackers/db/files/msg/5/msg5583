<p>On 4/14/10 I said:</p>
<p>"<em>I want it to be apart of events, the actual functionality is simple to port over. However, if we need a stop gap or something it's just a form so I can do that if it's an issue. The essential piece is that all of events should be under one umbrella so that creating events and managing events are all one in the same.</em></p>
<p><em>So, in this case the person would fill out the required information and it would go to Suzan/Whitney at which point it can be moved directly to the events section of our website if we want. So some of the main event widgets that we've added will have to go in that form. IE: Description of event etc etc. When I get a chance to do a second events demo i'll throw in a demo of how I for see this working.</em></p>
<p><em>I'm a little behind trying to fix relational bugs with FSD or I'd try to fit that in somewhere.</em>"</p>
<p>Events happened but that form was left out simply because I forgot it. I then manually programmed the form and put it here:&nbsp;<a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/events_request.htm">http://isaw.nyu.edu/events_request.htm</a>. On 03/08/11 Diane sent me an email and wanted the form updated she noted that it had too much info that didn't apply to internal applicants.</p>
<p>She put all of the necessary items together in a Word document for me on that same day. Unfortunately, it became a low priority as I was busy with other things and it fell through the cracks. Do the the nature of the form itself it will have to be something that I come back around to on the web side of things when we look at priorities there.</p>
<p>Attached is the form Diane sent me on 03/08/11 as to what she thought the final form should contain.</p>
