We have 2 open lines for the transmission of fire alarm status. According Mike, one line is transmitting positive alarm status constantly and this is still an issue. This could trigger a fire alarm status to the fire dept, which is a false positive and is fineable (expensive). We have had this problem in the past and downtown has fixed it within hours.
