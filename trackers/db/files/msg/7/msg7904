<p>There is a web ticket open for this if I recall correctly, the default view needs to be programmed in for this. We never got around to that and I had to do it manually last time hoping that I would get a chance to work on the website. Of course, that never happened; I'm looking at maybe Wednesday/Thursday I will begin getting around to web stuff.</p>
<p>As you know if I don't get to it it's likely i'm neck deep in something else.</p>
