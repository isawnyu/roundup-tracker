Dear Michael,
I have just tried making a photocopy using the machine on the 3rd floor, but everytime I try to enter my code, I get a message saying that I "don't have the privileges to use this function". I tried using the machine on the 4th floor and it works there.
Since I work on the 3rd floor (where my carrel is located), I normally use the copy machine on that floor. Is there anything I am doing wrong or not doing properly?
Thanks and have a great day,
Nico
