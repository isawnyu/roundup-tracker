<p>Email was sent, regarding this.. it reads:</p>
<p>To whom this may concern,</p>
<p>We have several book scanners here from ImageAccess at New York University. For the most part all of them seem to operate in correct fashion with the exception of the unit here at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW - http://isaw.nyu.edu). Over the last couple of months I have been in contact with ImageAccess as well as our own management as to the issues and concerns that our users have been expressing over this past year.</p>
<p>These issues involve the following regressions and defects:<br />Severe degradation after several scans.<br />When trying to scan a message being displayed that "The scanning process was interrupted."<br />The monitor turning off randomly.<br />When using a flash drive the process freezes midway and screen grays out.<br />When attempting to send email, the process freezing.<br />Sometimes the KIC software doesn't load.<br />The scanner bed light not turning on.<br />Touch panel not responding.<br />I'm sure there are many more defects that we've simply not been able to document because the behavior has been so erratic. Over this last year we have called your company several times in hopes of remedy. The software has been updated, the machine has been calibrated relentlessly and unfortunately these problems still plague us. We are at a juncture where it seems as if using the BookScanner is more of a losing game and frustrating experience not only for our library staff but for visiting research scholars, faculty and staff here at NYU. There is currently an open ticket with ImageAccess that assures us we'd get some form of software/firmware upgrade for the machine but the last attempt caused more problems than they solved.</p>
<p>ISAW's library is the heart of the institution and comprises collections that visiting research scholars, research associates and others across the globe need access to. It not only harms us as an institution to not have a working book scanner but leaves a marking and lasting impression on the scholars that use the machine to get work done for classes they teach, papers they write and so on. Not to mention the frustrating experience for our library staff who has tirelessly helped find work-arounds almost on a weekly basis to simply get their jobs done.</p>
<p>Earlier today I had another conversation about these problems and the relationship we have with ImageAccess with another one of your technicians in hopes that we may be able to solve this problem permanently. I was told that pending management approval a loaner scanner that is operational will be sent to us and we should send the defective unit back for operational and intensive testing as well as sending an email to this address here at support@dlsg.net.</p>
<p>It is in my deepest hopes that this course of action is approved by the management team at ImageAccess and that going forward this will help resolve the issue permanently so that we may be able to once again, properly use the book scanner.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
