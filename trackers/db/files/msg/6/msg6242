<p>O.k., so I guess I don't have permission to edit my own page because it <br />was created by an administrator. Also, in trying to fix it I created a <br />faux faculty member named Academic Director, NYU semester abroad program <br />in Egypt</p>
<p>I didn't publish anything, so I don't think it is visible on <br />http://isaw.nyu.edu/people/faculty but presumably it would be if I did <br />get access to my own account. Does this make any sense.</p>
<p>Feel free to call me at 347-301-7773 if it is easier to do this over the <br />phone.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />- Ellen</p>
