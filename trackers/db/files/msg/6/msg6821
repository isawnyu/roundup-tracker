<p>This sounds like a good plan to me, and is actually better than what I'd thought about doing a few years ago, namely replacing machines every 4 years. There's not really budget to do the latter on that kind of a timeline, but there is some and I think this might well be a good way to spend it in the near term. It will let us return to full operation much more quickly after an unexpected outage, and will allow us to extend machine lifetimes without running undue risks.</p>
<p>Go ahead and build the details so we can get a dollar figure. I bet we'll have enough in the hardware budget to do it.</p>
