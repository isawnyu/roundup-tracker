<p>The file was too big for a DVD. The software has been put on a external USB key and left in your mailbox with a copy of these instructions.</p>
<p>Instruction, if any of the below seems obvious please don't take it as me deeming you incapable of such a feat. I'm not sure why but lately persons have taking it that way and my stamina for that social dance is waning. I simply need to be as descriptive possible:</p>
<p>1. Slot USB Key<br />2. Double-click on CS4_Design Premium.dmg<br />3. Open Adobe CS4 Design Premium in the list.<br />4. It will open a window.. Select Setup<br />5. It'll prompt about the archive being downloaded from the internet. Select Open<br />6. Setup will want to make changes. Type your password and select OK<br />7. You'll see two ugly boxes bouncing in your dock, either ignore or entertain yourself with this as eventually a popup will be displayed.<br />8. It will say checking system profile... and take an eternity.<br />9. Depending on if you have an Adobe version installed you may even see 3 bouncing icons, slightly less entertaining at this point.&nbsp;<br />10. If you already have some of the CS4 suite installed it will show INSTALLED PRODUCTS in the right hand pane.<br />11. At the top of this list should be Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro.<br />12. If you just want that unselect everything else.<br />13. Otherwise select install.<br />14. Grab your cocktail/drink of choice and possibly a short chapter of reading material.<br />14. Once the install has been completed the Application will be in your Applications folder but moving your mouse to the upper right and selecting the magnifying glass will allow you to enter the title "Acrobat" which should display it as well.</p>
<p>Adobe will want to update the package almost immediately. In which case you should allow this to occur. &nbsp;Unfortunately i'm not sure how incessant this will become as I believe there are a couple of updates that will need tending with the "OK" button sadly and you'll have to click this repeatedly. It goes without saying the drink should be made to suffice and calm any fury due to this exercise.</p>
<p>Let me know how it goes.<br />&nbsp;</p>
