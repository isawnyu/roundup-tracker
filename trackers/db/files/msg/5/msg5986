<p>I have replied to it as follows:</p>
<p>Devin: <br /> <br />Thanks very much for this. A couple of follow-up questions: <br /> <br />1. How do we go about changing (or requesting a change) to the owners for these items? wn5 (William Naugle) has not been working at ISAW for over 3 years. tw38 (Tiffany Wall) does still work at ISAW, but is probably not the right person to be the primary owner of the resources. <br /> <br />2. How do we modify the list of rooms that can be scheduled? We've added some new space and repurposed others. <br /> <br />If there's a how-to or document on this, please point us in the right direction. <br /> <br />Thanks, <br />Tom&nbsp;</p>
