Dear Mike,

The exhibition department is having a press viewing hour and opening reception for the upcoming exhibition on Thursday November 11th. The press viewing hour is 5-6 PM and opening reception is 6-8 PM. We are expecting between 125-150 people at the reception. We please need the following set up by 4 PM.
1. A 6 foot table in the lobby for check in.
2. The majority of the chairs and coffee tables removed from the oak library.
3. The large table moved against the south wall.
4. The large couches moved against the walls (maybe at an angle?)

Could we please schedule a time to review everything in person?

Thank you,
Irene
