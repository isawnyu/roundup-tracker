Hrmm, ITS will hassle me over the no netid issue because they will not want to assign an actual email account to this. What you can do is create an external email account ie: isaw.registrar@gmail.com and then we can have ITS create an alias that forwards all incoming email from isaw.registrar@nyu.edu to that email account. If it's not too much hassle then i'll move this forward sometime today.
