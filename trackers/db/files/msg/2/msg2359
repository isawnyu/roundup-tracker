I just got off the phone with ITS who state the issue has been assigned to a group within ITS and that is all the information they currently have. The most that could be done for me was to flag the ticket as high urgency. I will call ITS tomorrow again and begin to escalate the issue until we can get this resolved.

If it is at all possible for me to remedy the issue myself, or speak with the exact person or group handling the ticket I will do so.
