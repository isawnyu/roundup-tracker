<p>I really like the new advanced search, but either I'm not understanding something or there's a boundary condition that's misbehaving. I went to advanced search and left everything default except I set department to "isawit" and status to "not resolved" and clicked the search button. The result set seemed indeed to be limited to isawit, but I saw a number of tickets whose status was marked "resolved" which was not what I expected. This same behavior (resolved showing in response to a "not resolved" criterion) also occurs if I leave the department as "don't care"</p>
