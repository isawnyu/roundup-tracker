<p>I don't know if this is similar to the problem Jennifer had in Kazakhstan, but my iPhone is constantly giving me a message "Cannot get mail. The connection to the server failed." It does from time to time actually seem to pick up messages, but often after long delays, and most of the time it's just giving this error message. It also didn't this morning seem to be willing to connect to the web via Safari, either. The problem is not a result of not having an AT&amp;T signal, as that looks quite robust.</p>
