<p>All software is installed and the machine is currently updating. When that is complete we will wait to hear from Diane on Monday. It's likely I wont be in until the afternoon but unfortunately I'm not sure just yet. In any event I don't expect there to be an issue but should there be one please attach to this ticket and follow-up with Rohan.</p>
