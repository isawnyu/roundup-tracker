Hi Kate:

The changes are up for your review at: 

http://isaw3.atlantides.org/isaw/courses_09F.htm

Let me know if they're ok to publish to the main site.

Note that, in addition to the changes you specified, I took the liberty of altering the page title, breadcrumbs and some headings to make it more clear that the page is for courses for the entire academic year, not just fall 2009.

Best,
Tom
