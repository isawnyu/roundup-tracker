<p>You start writing an email, after which you pause, you walk away. Mail saves a draft. You come back to writing the email, pause. Maybe send, maybe start over, maybe send a copy somewhere else. Each time there is a significant edit and pause of some sort Mail actually saves a draft. Whilst doing this it also indexes into something called Spotlight, which keeps Apple Mails index as well. So you end up with something that looks like..&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even though you only sent one message, Apple Mail updates much quicker but to turn message search off in spotlight simply click the magnifying screen in the upper right and select Spotlight Preferences at the bottom of the list. From there you can deselect messages/chats.</p>
