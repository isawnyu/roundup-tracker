Muriel,

Unfortunately, we are not able to fulfill your request for a secondary monitor.  We were able to let Christine temporarily use a monitor we already had in reserve for IT-related support services.  We have an agreement that we may need to reclaim it at any time.  As with our policy on laptops, ISAW does not purchase monitors for use by the scholars; however, you are certainly welcome to bring one to use if you find another available.  Very often, monitors can be found inexpensively or free in places like http://www.craiglist.org.
