<p>I have checked it out and it is not the smell of gasoline or kerosene. We turned on both fireplaces and they are operating normally. The smell is chemical in nature and strongest in the northeast corner of the Oak Library and the small Gallery. The larger Gallery, front offices, and the Lecture Hall do not smell (although the Seminar Room is in use this afternoon). I do not detect the smell in the basement, the front offices on the first floor, the floors other than 1 &amp; 2, or outside the front door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Termaine Jacobs (gallery security) says he conveyed this to Mike earlier this afternoon.</p>
<p>While this is not the smell of fuel, it is concerning. I have raised the priority level.</p>
