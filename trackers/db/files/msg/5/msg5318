You'll need to order Microsoft Office Standard 2011 and the computer store can indeed install it for you. That aside if you plan to use your computer here through our wired network you'll have to get it setup for such operation. I'd need the MAC address, if you are around Thursday July 14th. I will be here and we can get that done then as well as any other questions you may have.
