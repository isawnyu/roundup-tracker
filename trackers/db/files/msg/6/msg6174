<p>I don't even know what those room numbers refer to. &nbsp;All of our iCal calendars are by name, as follows:<br /><br />ISAW Events (this is a separate calendar for things that affect the entire building)<br />Oak Library<br />Lecture Hall<br />Seminar Room<br />Gallery 1<br />Gallery 2<br />Large Conf. Room<br />Small Conf. Room<br />Holidays (separate calendar for holidays that aren't necessarily NYU holidays but allow us to note days we might want to avoid scheduling on -- Jewish holidays, marathon weekend, UN General Assembly, etc.)<br /><br /><br />Whitney</p>
