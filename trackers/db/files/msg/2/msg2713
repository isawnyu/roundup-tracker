So as an update here.. I've made a copy of all the data on the laptop. With specific focus on Julienne's folder which I have a copy of on an External drive as well as my own laptop.  There is a copy of the full HD image going to the backup folder now.

As it looks like some core binary files were modified which is why the computer is failing to boot I won't restore from an image in this case. 

Next steps are reinstalling Mac OSX on the laptop. Julienne has a copy of needed files right now on the Macbook and we'll work our way from here.
