<p>One other point to keep in mind is that it would ideally be possible for &nbsp;the same equipment to support the editorial work on the Journal of Inner &nbsp;Asian Archaeology and Art, which is based at ISAW. I say this because of&nbsp;concern that the current research associates office will one of these&nbsp;days turn into a development office, leaving nowhere for Judith to keep&nbsp;journal files and do editorial work.</p>
