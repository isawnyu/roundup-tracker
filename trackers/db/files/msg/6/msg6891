<p>There is one machine left to overhaul that I just pulled from Abby's office. The MACS need the drive upgrades for the 320's so that if a drive dies they can be swapped. The ability to swap out machines without having to worry about any of the details proved useful today as Abby's machine completely died again (that specific machine is a problem) and a swap out took 9 minutes total.</p>
