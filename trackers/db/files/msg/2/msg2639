I started officially on 10/18 and understand Mike's help is needed in the move. I need assistance porting my calendar into my ISAW calendar. I would also like a little assistance with getting up and running. I would appreciate a half-hour of someone's time by Monday 10/25 so I get a little more efficient.

This is also my first helpdesk ticket, so I guess I've learned something!
