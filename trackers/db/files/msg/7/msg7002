<p>I'm not going to waste anymore time with this device, it's simply insufficient for the needs of the ISAW user community. Primarily because it works so poorly but also because it simply doesn't have any group functionality. Quite frankly, it should be thrown in the trash. I'm cc'n Roger on this ticket so he is aware of this decision. In the interim i'll open a new ticket on investigating a useful cloud solution that will work for ISAW.</p>
