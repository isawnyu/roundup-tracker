<p>We are good to purchase the standard Dell configuration (see below). Christopher, do you want to do this, or would you like me to take it since you're dealing with the server etc.? T</p>

<p>Ah you just said let me know if anything caused me concern, Tom, and it <br />didnt. You were being too subtle, and most of my other emailers were <br />being demanding! so you lost out. Anyway, to confirm, the Dell will be <br />fine for me.<br />Apologies, Robert.</p>

Our<br />&gt;&gt; systems administrator, Christopher Warner, is double-checking to make<br />&gt;&gt; sure there aren't any known deficits with this package, but meantime I<br />&gt;&gt; attach an overview for your information. Please let us know if anything<br />&gt;&gt; indicated here (e.g., monitor size, hard-drive size) causes you concern.<br />&gt;&gt; NB: We'll order the software separately, so you won't see it listed <br />&gt;&gt; there.<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt; Best,<br />&gt;&gt; Tom</p>
