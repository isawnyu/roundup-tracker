<p>We are having some calendaring issues, where recurring events are disappearing when they have not been deleted, or one event in a series is changed intentionally and all subsequent events disappear. This is problematic for the shared spaces for tutorials and seminars and has caused some conflicts lately. Whitney can provide specifics, if helpful.</p>
