<p>If a provider or object isn't available via dropdown or higher level layer in the skin the whole website goes down. This is unacceptable, so our theme and layers need to be updated to fail gracefully in a situation where a current object may be temporarily unavailable from the dropdown in the left column.</p>
<p>So for instance, if a module is removed; isaw.leftcol should simply go ahead and simply not display it. Adding an event message or notice to isaw.it@nyu.edu that a needed module has been removed. I'll have to write a work around for this sometime tonight, as this happened today whilst upgrading isaw.events.</p>
