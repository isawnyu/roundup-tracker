<p>Yes unfortunately this would have to be prioritized. I've wanted to do archive.isaw.nyu.edu for sometime now but I don't have the time or resources. Time wise for a proper implementation we are looking at between 3-4 weeks of my uninterrupted time to see it completed. There are many other building blocks on the table before this however that would need to be put into place.</p>
