<p>The microphone was not working for the lecture tonight. All the lights were lighting up, registering sound, but nothing was coming from the speaker. The remote mute was not on and everything seemed to be operational. I have no idea what is wrong. If you cannot fix it on Friday, please let me know so that we can call Monolith Modular to come in before Wednesday's lecture.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
