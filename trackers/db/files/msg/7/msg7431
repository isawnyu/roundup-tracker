<p>I just inspected this, it's not a cable problem. It's simply that the computer has gone into energy saver mode. What i've done is extended this to an hour. If no one uses the machine in an hour, the display will go into energy saver mode. It was currently at 15 minutes or so. If you'd prefer it not do that and just go to a screensaver or some such let me know and i'll update that.</p>
