<p>One of the paired outlets in the 2nd floor kitchen (the one closest to the sink) is periodically malfunctioning.&nbsp; If you try to plug appliances into both sides of it (as we usually do with no problems), it triggers the circuit breaker and has to be reset -- it only stays on if only one appliance is plugged in.&nbsp; Often by the next day it is back to normal, but as this has happened a couple of times it possibly needs to be checked for a short in its fuse.</p>
