<p>Possibly a job for Ben? Once upon a time ISAW administration managed various mailing list data in one or more filemaker pro database (Kate, for example, remembers some details). I knew about it, but never saw it myself.</p>
<p>We need to try to find whatever remains of this database, which was probably stored on the server (or possibly on Suzan Toma's computer, of which we should still have an image somewhere). It would be nice to have finished the search and reported results by cabinet meeting this Wednesday morning (10/19), but that may be too ambitious given other tasks in progress. If that doesn't work, would it be possible to have done the search and have results to report at the next cabinet meeting, which is on 10/26?</p>
<p>Thanks, Tom</p>
