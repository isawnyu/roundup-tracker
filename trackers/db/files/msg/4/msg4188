Hi Christopher,

Diane told me that you want Ben to work on &quot;my&quot; problem--which may well be part  of a larger one. (As you can see the &quot;From&quot; box reads &quot;NYU &quot; as I send it but I believe it will be only &quot;NYU&quot; when you receive it + it will not go via NYU but only via my Earthlink account). I plan to be here tomorrow afternoon, though in Soren's seminar either form 1-4 or 2-5.
