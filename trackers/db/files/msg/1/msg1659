I've made appropriate changes on the main page and on the location/hours page. If I can step away from family obligations for a time this evening, I will remove it after 8:00 p.m. as you requested. I'm also going to make a similar change on the exhibitions page on the main ISAW site, where the hours are also repeated. That should be published within the next 20 minutes or so.

Best,
Tom
