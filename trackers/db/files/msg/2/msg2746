Hi guys:

There's going to be a digital papyrology meeting at ISAW on Saturday and one of the participants can't make it from Germany. I'd like to be able to beam him in via skype, and so would like to have a spare laptop (cabled rather than wireless if possible), plus power supply to use on Saturday. I'll be at ISAW on Friday, so can collect everything then.

Will that work?

Thanks,
Tom
