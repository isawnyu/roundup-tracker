<p>email from Ellen Morris:</p>
<p>Strange thing. &nbsp;I think your phone is dialing mine at odd hours. &nbsp;Yesterday at 6:35 a.m. I got a call and the message made it sound like a pocket dial. &nbsp;There was lots of fuzziness and what sounded perhaps like muffled Chinese announcements--so I figured it was an accident while you were at the airport or something. &nbsp;Last night, though, I got another call at 12:35 at night! &nbsp;That also had a short message of silence. &nbsp;Considering that I know you don't keep those hours, I figure it was another pocket dial from a different time zone. &nbsp;Any clue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to which I add: Ellen's phone called mine at 0535 one morning (Chinese time), and I had the same experience (no one there).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any experience with this kind of thing? Ways of preventing one's phone from doing weird things?</p>
