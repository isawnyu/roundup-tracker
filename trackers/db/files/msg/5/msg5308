Per discussion with Diane and Tom on 7/7/11:

Lorenzo will be arriving in late July (official start date 1 August). He does *not* have a netid, and may not have one by then, because of delays involving his visa. Therefore it will be necessary to communicate with him via his current email (lorenzo.dalfonso@unipv.it) or other email to be provided by Kate.

He already has an account on the ISAW website. He will need the other standard capabilities (printer/copier, laptop/desktop hookup, etc).

His desktop computer is already on order:

Hardware: iBuy Purchase Order EW413672 (Dell: 6/30/11)
Software: iBuy Purchase Order EW413673 (NYU computer store: 6/30/11)

His laptop has not yet been ordered. I will be working on this over the next week and will append details here when I have them.
