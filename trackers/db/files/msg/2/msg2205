I would appreciate it if Dwayne could sweep up the lecture hall as we ate lunch in there today. Also, we noticed that there seems to be trash that has accumulated outside the windows on the right side of the lecture hall on that faux-balcony area. I'm assuming this is probably from the construction, so if we could get that cleaned up as well that would be great.
Thanks!!
