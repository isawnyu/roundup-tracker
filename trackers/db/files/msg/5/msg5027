(1) Is possible we will need to closely outline the functionality that you have become accustom to on Windows and make sure that transition to the Mac is easier sans the remaining Windows applications in Parallels.

(2) Professionally i'd recommend an unlocked iphone. From what I am aware of Android is just not an international companion in the same way as an iphone. In my case it has been steadfast and it's still the 3g model from 2008. In that time I've used it everywhere except Northern Africa and Australia/NZ and it's worked pretty decently through-out Europe, the Caribbean and Southern America. It's a little spotty sometimes but if the network is GSM it can dual-mode between the bands. I'll most likely be using it in Singapore/China shortly. I'm a fan of syncing up my data and continuing on about my business. I don't have time to play around with quirks etc of the smartphone.

That aside, if you do go Android i'd recommend multiple batteries and looking into a good sync program for your Mac workflow. I simply can't give proper advice on Android aside adhoc commentary. So my professional opinion is that I believe it to be subpar. Maybe Google will figure out power management and proper api rather than just thinking that having an open platform will make things better.

All that said i'm not a proponent of the iphone because they are Apple but because it works with the least possible effort. Before this I had a Blackberry 8800 which worked well almost everywhere but the trackball couldn't seem to stay inside of it. After an embarrassment at an awards ceremony, I got the rid of it.
