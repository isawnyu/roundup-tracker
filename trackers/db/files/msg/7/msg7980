<p>I am in! After almost onehour it started. I believe the problem is when I switch it off. Last week when I went home at evening it had 32 updates to do. my fear is that updating takes such a long time that it falls asleep before switching off, and when I switch it on in the morning, it has serious problems to restart.</p>
<p>In any case, ti does not work properly, I continue to be afraid</p>
