Dear Mike,
while giving a presentation today in the conference room on the 2nd floor (purple room) I have noticed that one of the shades on the long wall does not work (the motor is functioning but the shade is somewhat stuck and does not descend).
Not a big problem for me, I just want to let you know.
Roberta
