<p>One of the speakers who was scheduled for Lillian's Antiquity conference on Sept. 28th has broken his leg and can no longer attend in person. One of the other participants will read the paper/powerpoint for him, but I am hoping to be able to have him on Skype while the presentation is given so that he can listen and also answer questions as the end. Can you go over this with me to make sure this will work and help me figure out how to set it up?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
