Leon Levy lecture will be held Thurs. Nov. 4th at 6:00pm in the Oak Library. As Campus Media will be coming on that day to set up the AV in the library, I'm not sure that any testing more than a couple of hours before the lecture will be possible. Thus I request that someone from the IT department be available at that time (about 4pm) to assist with the testing. Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Kate
