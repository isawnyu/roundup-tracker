Tom Elliott and his digital projects team will be holding a workshop in the large gallery (the one adjoining the first floor kitchen) Tuesday Sept. 28 - Thursday Sept. 30.  The boxes of books that are in the gallery can remain where they are, but we will need either one large table or two small tables and six chairs to be placed in the gallery.  (If we need to borrow the table from the second floor kitchen, that is okay.)
