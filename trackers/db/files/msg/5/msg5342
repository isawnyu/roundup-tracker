Kate's laptop is due for a replacement and we should probably cycle it out, this is actually Julienne's old laptop that was sent in for repair and she shouldn't be using it. It was simply a stop gap measure.

We've have considerable downtime with this whole process as this has been a critical issue since April. As it stands I've spent approximately 24 hours if not more at this point specifically for this problem. The main issues were the battery; then the motherboard for the machine had to be replaced. Then there was a delay in actually getting the repaired laptop. Then the repaired laptop wasn't actually repaired and had to be sent back. It was sent back and there was more delay in picking the laptop up. The laptop still did not function correctly upon return and we should waste no more time here.
