<p>Something is inteferring with the wireless signal in Roger's office.. I'm not sure what it is, but it is an annoyance. It seems to cut in and out. I've gone ahead and plugged into the gigabit network so that obviously helps but I suspect someday we should find out what is causing the interference.</p>
