<p>I have twice set up a gCal recurring event for Cabinet, including a reminder. It appears that each time, most participants on the list accepted the event, then the recurring aspect didn't work.</p>
<p>Is this a known bug or is there something else I need to do to make this recur (with reminder)?</p>
