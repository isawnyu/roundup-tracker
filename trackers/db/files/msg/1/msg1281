Dear Mike:

Ordinarily, I would fill out a ticket for the following request, but because it pertains to Shelby's wireless access
I thought it would be more appropriate to email you directly.

I realize that Tim never wrote out clear instructions for connecting Shelby's laptop (MacBook Air?) to the wireless network.
If one doesn't use the wireless network every day, it's very easy to forget how to connect. To be honest with you, I use my wired desktop 100%
of the time, so I don't know how to connect laptops.

Mike, is there any way, when you have a moment on Monday, that you could write out instructions on how Shelby can connect her
laptop to the network -- using her own NYU net id and her own NYU password --- not the guest WiFi password which changes every week for security purposes.
She's technically not a guest.

If Shelby does not already have an active NYU net id and NYU email, I'd like to get one for her. She doesn't have to use the email,
but the net id will be very handy for using the wireless network, the wiki etc. 

I'd like to have a copy of the instructions so that I can do this if you're not in the building; I'd also like to leave a copy in Shelby's office.
If there is anything that I'm overlooking on the ITS side, please do let me know.

As always, thank you for your help.

Best,
Suzan
