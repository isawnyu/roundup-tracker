<p>I have Parallels and 2007 Excel installed on my machine, which should be the correct software/versions to make Hyperion Planning run. However, when I try to pull down our financial data, even the smallest dataset says "The request timed out. Contact your administrator to increase netRetryCount and netRetryInterval."</p>
<p>When I try to pull the Budget office form down, I get "There is no valid data for this data form." This makes me think this is a Financial Planning office problem, but I can't tell. Can you?</p>
<p>We have a training program tomorrow and Tiffany and I are expected to be able to look at the data and work on it between sessions and neither of us seems to be able to access the data - she got similar error messages, although I realize she also has an Excel version conflict.</p>
<p>Anything that can be done to shed light on if the problem is on our side or Financial Planning would be helpful.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
