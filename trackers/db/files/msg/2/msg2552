The repairman for the oven and stovetop came this afternoon and was not able to find anything wrong with the operation of either appliance themselves, however, he did check the voltage that was going to the stovetop and it was only getting 120 volts, though it says on the label that it is supposed to be operating with 229 volts.  His suggestion was that someone plug a voltage meter in to one of the appliances and leave it for about half an hour to see if it is consistently low or if the level changes over time.
