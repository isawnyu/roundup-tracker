<p>The white kitchen cart developed a broken wheel this afternoon and is currently too unstable to transport dishes.&nbsp; Could Mike or Dwayne please look at it and determine if it can be repaired?&nbsp; It is currently in the second floor kitchen. Desiree has more information about what the problem is should you need it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
