Dear Mike,

The exhibitions department is hosting a lecture followed by a reception. The lecture will be in the Lecture hall 6-7 PM and the reception will be in the Oak Library 7-8 PM. We kindly request the lecture hall to have about 60 chairs and the podium. No furniture needs to be removed from the Oak Library.

Thank you,
Irene
