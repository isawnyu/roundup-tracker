<p>Not much that I can do about this unfortunately, I'll go ahead and send some more email out today but I don't have much control over wireless connectivity. As for the ticket system, I do have control over that but it's not up to me as to where I spend my time. I'm sure if you identified your main gripes in a ticket Tom/Roger would someday see it fit for me to spend the appropriate amount of time to do the programming. Of course, the list is rather long as stands currently.</p>
