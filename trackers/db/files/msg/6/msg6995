<p>Right. My todo now is two-fold: (1) find out from Ackerman who within ITS has care and feeding responsibilities for the "Advance" system that UDAR uses to track donor relationships, and (2) request from UDAR an account on "Advance" so I can get familiar with the system.</p>
<p>Christopher: background: we're looking into what UDAR already uses for relationship management since there's potentially big advantage in sharing the system with them since we'll be working together on prospects, donor management, etc. As I get familiar with the system I'll be looking at what it does and doesn't do for more general contact management and asking about whether there's a way we can integrate with one of the other services for same.</p>
<p>So I'll post updates here. I'm going to take ownership of this ticket for now.</p>
