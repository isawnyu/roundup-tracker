Suzan and Tiffany,

Roger has asked me to go ahead and process the VRS acceptance and rejection letters.

Please find attached the acceptance and rejection letters I have done. The 'track changes' function is still on the acceptance letter and I have a few changes there that I just did that Suzan should just check off on. I think it should be complete at that point.

We have a wait-list group as well. I will draft a letter for them as soon as possible.

Tim, would you help them with VRS application system? I will submit a ticket for you -- just let me know how I should word this task!

Best wishes,
Anna
