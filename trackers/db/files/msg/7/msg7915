<p>Dawn doesn't have the cable and it's not available on ibuy so we used a temporary adapter that Mike had lying around for another printer in his office. We need to order the replacement but this worked. The printer will also need color/black ink to be ordered for it as it's not the laserjet so that needs to be done as well before closing out this ticket. However, Mike can indeed print now.</p>
