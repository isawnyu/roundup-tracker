Michael:

As discussed today, I'd like to see us tighten down a bit on accident-prevention security on the scanning machines. Specifically, I'd like:

* John and Nate trained to log out and log in to their machines, esp. when leaving for the day

* embargo access to the big LaCie RAID for anyone other than Nate, John, myself and admin

* create a new account for general-use scanning on the scanner machine

* create policy for use of the scanner machine (short and sweet; stuff like "don't leave your files on the machine") and post same to wiki

OK?

thanks,
Tom
