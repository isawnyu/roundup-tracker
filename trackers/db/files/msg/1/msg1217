Dawn,

I talked to Roddy Austin at 8-2495 this afternoon.  He's weighing the complications of whether or not he should send a new machine up with the tech in order to avoid the need to make two trips.  He also isn't sure how to transport the machines yet.  He's going to have another conversation with Cynthia and follow up with sending a tech.
