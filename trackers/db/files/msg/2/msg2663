I had a talk with Seth about this should he have anymore questions he'll come back and speak with Michael during office hours but he's looking at getting a Macbook Air most likely 2.13ghz with 256gb and the trimmings.  He isn't doing any that would require heavy processing so it seems like a rather good fit.
