<p>Old Europe data sits on isaw4.atlantides.org and has been imported to the mysql instance there. The problem now is that it seems drupal 6 needs some esoteric regexes I'll have to add to nginx. The theme for this site was embedded in the theme directory but a mix of static html and php was used that seemingly override drupal proper. It's all just a complete mess. Maybe tomorrow i'll try to come up with a couple of regexes that can make it work somehow.</p>
