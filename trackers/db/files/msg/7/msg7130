<p>I'm working in a file on the server which I've been using a lot over the past few days. New this morning I'm getting an error every time I try to copy to the server "There has been a network or file permission error. The network connection may be lost. (filename). Because I'm working on important documents for the 5th anniversary document, I don't want to lose any of my work, but Whitney and I are now sharing the files and I can't move the folder to my hard drive.</p>
<p>It has refused to overwrite a document when I've made changes, but it has saved documents to the folder.&nbsp;</p>
