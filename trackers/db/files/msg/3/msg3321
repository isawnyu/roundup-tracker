I thought Michael had installed Microsoft office for parallels on my computer. I just tried to run a brio report to excel, though, and it was trying to open my Mac excel, which wasn\'t going to work. Chris, when you get a chance, can you come by and see if I\'m just missing something?

Thanks!

Kate
