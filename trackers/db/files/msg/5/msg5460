<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>I am currently unable to even open my copy of Acrobat Pro because it is asking me for an administrator password to "make changes."&nbsp; This may just be because Adobe needs to update, but I'm going to need to use it soon for a project that needs to be done before the end of the month, so if you could either come and look at it or let me know what the password is that would be great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Whitney</p>
