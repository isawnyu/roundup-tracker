<p>I've been meaning to write this ticket for sometime but now I have a bit of a better idea of what needs to happen and a sliver of time. RM 605/606 is simply a mess and has been so for a while, it has irked me incessantly since the move to the 6th floor. Unfortunately part of this is due to the fact that we don't have any storage which is understandable. However the other part of this is that the port, electrical outlets and alignments aren't really conducive to having more than one place to plug items in to. So we end up with a mess of wires about and junk that we probably no longer need. In that vein we have an absolute total of 4 desk grommets which has proved inadequate for how the space is currently being used. There also needs to be some process in making sure that we recycle, sell or throw the items that we have no use for in the trash where they belong. Only if because it helps with the limited amount of space that we currently have. We also need to run cable rails under the desk in order to prevent the unsightly wire situation. Fire hazard issues aside, it is simply unattractive and doesn't need to be that way. The below is only part of the room but it's slightly ridiculous.<br /><br /><img style="border-image: initial; border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;" title="Absolute wire madness" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5510475/rm605.JPG" alt="RM 605" width="400" height="533" />&nbsp;<img title="Background on Room 605" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5510475/rm605-2.JPG" alt="RM 605 2" width="400" height="533" /></p>
<p><br />My suggestions are to:</p>
<p>1. We need at least double the grommets, wider, with a slight raise, preferably maple wood or whatever these desk are made out of so that they match the grain. This involves a drill, drill bit and putting the grommet in place.<br />2. Cable rails under the desk. This involves a drill, drill bit, screwdriver and screws.<br />3. Anything that we are not using, we simply need to get rid of and get it out of this room. This involves itemizing what we need from what we actually don't need and chucking it.</p>
<p>The goal is to provide a clean and useful working environment that doesn't look like the set of some bad "cyber punk" movie.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
