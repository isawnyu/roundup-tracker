<p>I realized in teaching this Tuesday that the laptop used in the seminar room has no facilities for supporting entry of Greek. This makes it impossible to (for example) show the class how to use papyri.info to suggest emendations. One of these days there will be something better, but for the moment, I would like to get GreekKeys put onto this machine.</p>
