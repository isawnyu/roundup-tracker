<p>Judith:</p>
<p>I'm not sure why, but the website didn't know about you as a user. I've fixed that. You'll login with judith.lerner@nyu.edu as your username. You should have received a separate email with the password (let me know if it didn't come through). I've given you ownership permissions over your personal profile and you should also have permission to create news items. Let me know if you run into any problems.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
