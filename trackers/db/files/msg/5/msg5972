<p>Walked through the building and found that on the 1st and 2nd floors there are problems with 802.11a devices but that is all.. The connectivity is slightly lower but not enough to be problematic; Anyone using a 802.11a device however, which should be the rarity, will have to figure something out.</p>
<p>There is a definite problem however on the 5th floor that i'm waiting to hear about.</p>
