Spoke with Irene briefly and she stated in lieu of the above that we should move forward with the email alias. So after thinking about it isaw.exhibitions@nyu.edu should forward to a gmail account.

This solves the problem two-fold. Firstly, it alleviates any clogging of Irene's inbox so that she doesn't spend time building complicated filters and a complex hierarchy just to manage mail.

Secondly, we can then use the gmail to forward to multiple accounts should we need to in the future.

Yes, it is a loop-hole, based on NYU-NET policy this is legal, conversely should we be challenged on this topic NYU as a whole is moving to gmail anyway.
