Tom,

I hooked the hard drive with the image of the previous system up to ISAW Server and copied the old wiki files into the techgroup/web/archived wiki folder.  I hope that you're able to find what you need inside this copy.  With the rotation of machines we've had, I'm not sure what would happen if I put the spare iMac on the network and booted it from the hard drive.   When we originally tried this, it knocked the 10.6 server off the network and was kind of messy to fix.
