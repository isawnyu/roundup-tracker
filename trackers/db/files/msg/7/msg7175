<p>I have about 5 different "4th floor printer" options showing on my print screen and none of them seem to actually work.&nbsp; Could someone please come clean this up and get it to actually work?&nbsp; I don't use the printer that often but I prefer to use it when I'm printing a large number of pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
