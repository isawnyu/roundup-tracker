<p>This was fixed but because there is a window of time for the actual update to occur and because I don't want to stop any existing workflows, have anyone show up at ISAW at the wrong time or rock the boat more than necessary. We are going to defer this again until the current events run their course. Most likely towards the summer we will have this remedied. It's important so it will remain a high priority.</p>
