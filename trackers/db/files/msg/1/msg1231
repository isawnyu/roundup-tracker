Mantha,

I regret that my ability to troubleshoot your problems with the new OS are limited by what I'm allowed to support through ISAW.  In this case, since your laptop is not owned by the institute, I might only be able to recommend other places that you may go to seek help.  Of course I'd be happy to take a quick look and see what type of problem you may have and make the best recommendation I can.  I'll be around until 2 today and from 10 to 2 tomorrow.
