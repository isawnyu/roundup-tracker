Jennifer,

The login and password for your blackberry *should* be the same as your nyu NetID.  I would try jyc4@nyu.edu and the password on the following link:  http://bis.na.blackberry.com/html?brand=mycingular

I'm unclear about why your password might expire, since sits directly linked through NYU, but I'd like to get you up and running and then troubleshoot that problem when you're back in the US.

I can be reached at 212-992-7845 until 2 if you have any questions.

Best of luck,
Michael
