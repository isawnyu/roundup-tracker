Keith doesn't think the outcome of this is going to look good but I've asked him to forward anyway to the security team to see if there is anything that they will be able to do.

Right now, security is going to contact Irene if they are able to get this data. Just so we set expectations Keith think it's going to be bleek but we'll just have to wait and see.
