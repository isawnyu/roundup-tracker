So I took a look at this and it there was a problem with the account as it interfaced with the iCal server. Something probably got munged somewhere. We removed the iCal account on the client machine and restarted the iCal client. From there we added the account again and everything looks good. We'll wait to see if she gets any more pop ups by the end of the day but she should be ok.
