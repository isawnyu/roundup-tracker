Dear both,

I would like to create a folder on the server for &quot;Administrative Reporting&quot;, I am trying to find a more convenient way to keep track of expenses, allow different departments to keep track of their own expenses as well as post monthly Brio reports an quarterly reports. I would require many subcategories that I would be happy to create myself if I can be given a short lesson on how to. Let me know if this is possible or if you have a better idea on how to do this. Access to this folder would be given to myself, Whitney, Kate, Diane, Tom, Chuck and Roger as well as our new workstudy who will be assisting with updates.

Thanks,
