<p>Chris, <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/Members/sebastian.heath-40nyu.edu/copy_of_isaw-papers">http://isaw.nyu.edu/Members/sebastian.heath-40nyu.edu/copy_of_isaw-papers</a>&nbsp;is in my folder. That should replace <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/publications/isaw-papers">http://isaw.nyu.edu/publications/isaw-papers</a>&nbsp;, keeping the old address. This is what we talked about so I hope this brief message makes sense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* but one note, there is another document with the same visible title. The one modified 2/24 is the new one.</p>
<p>Alex and his co-author are psyched to get this out so many thanks. -S.</p>
