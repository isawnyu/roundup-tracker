<p>This machine needs to be upgraded these are probably security related updates/itunes/etc/etc mac osx updates. Diane should be an administrator on her machine so it should require her administrator password. If that's not the case then her account needs to be promoted and the updates installed here. If I get a moment tonight I will take care of this, if not i'll have Benjamin do so.</p>
