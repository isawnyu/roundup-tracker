Hi again,

Sorry to bother you but as I use my laptop, things are coming up that are missing that I need. I no longer have Adobe Acrobat on my laptop. I have the Reader version but I need to be able to edit and manipulate my pdf files.

Is this something we can install on my laptop?

Thanks so much,
Julienne
