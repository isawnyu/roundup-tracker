For archiving, it's essential that the files not be dependent on any one piece of software, so both the Thunderbird and the Apple routes seem to me unacceptable. I think I can download a folder to "local", then open it with Nota Bene (far better than Word!), and store as RTF. That at least gives a searchable and portable file. It tends to lose formatting, but that's relatively uninformative. Ideal would be a solution that didn't just turn it all into text, but kept it in some kind of structure (dumping it into a database format, or a spreadsheet?).
