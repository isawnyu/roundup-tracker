Hi Tom/Sean,

I know this is super last-minute, but Shelby was asking so I hope it can be squeezed into your busy schedules. The time of the Sarcophagus Conference is missing from the page. Could we just add the time on the 'Events' page under the 'Date: October 2-3'? Just a line that reads: 

'Time: 9:00am-6:00pm
       Friday Reception at 6:00pm'

Many, Many, Many thanks.
