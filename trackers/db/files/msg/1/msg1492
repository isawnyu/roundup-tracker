Dear Mike,

This is the follow-up ticket for the concert the exhibitions department is hosting this Friday January 22, 7-8 PM in the Lecture Hall. We had the concert rehearsal last night and everything went well. They brought almost all their own equipment. I lent them an extension cord, which they will use for the concert as well and return to me. Instead of removing chairs we need to please add another row of chairs and fill up the back as well. Additionally we may have a larger crowd since the galleries are open until 8 PM and there is a free tour at 6 PM so could we have some chairs on reserve in the seminar room. I checked the events calendar and there are no events during the next two days in that room. Would it be possible to ask Dwayne to stay until 4 PM on Friday to help set up the equipment?

As always let me know if you want to walk through the room and discuss the details in person.

Thanks,
Irene
