<p>I moved this past year's scholars to a new alumni folder for 2011-12, but the view is not the same as the other years. Only the names show up, whereas with the other years, the images, title, etc. show up in the list view. Is there something I did wrong, or a something I need to click to get them to all look the same?</p>
