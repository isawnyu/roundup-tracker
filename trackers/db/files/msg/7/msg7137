<p>I rebooted my machine and installed all software upgrades, though I don't think any of them were relevant. I have tested all the functions that were problematic this morning and all seems to be working. I'm closing this ticket but my HD was making noises again this morning, so leaving the other ticket for my machine open (sorry!)</p>
