<p>I was unable to use the google group as a destination (in lieu of email addresses), so if this will improve the experience, if you can give me some guidance as to how, I'd be glad to try. The google group has email addresses in it not tied to a gCal (several personal gmails), so these all are rejected, by example.</p>
