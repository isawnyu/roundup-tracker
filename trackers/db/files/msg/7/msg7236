<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>Members of the community are reporting that they are not receiving emailed scans, despite the message on the Bookeye screen stating that the file has been sent.&nbsp; Also, even if someone is emailing a JPEG file, the initial "saving" message says: Saving PDF to USB.</p>
<p>More fun with Bookeye!</p>
