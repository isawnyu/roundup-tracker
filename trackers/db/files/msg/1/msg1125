hi Michael,

I'm a new VRS at ISAW and I am only able to access the wireless through nyuguest and I would like to know how I can get the normal network and also how I can install the printer on my computer.
I'm in the 5th floor, and will be in all day today. I'm also afraid that I won't be able to access the nyu guest network after this Week End.
Help!

Caroline
