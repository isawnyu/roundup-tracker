<p>I'll stop by the Apple store Lincoln Center and pickup the new one at Wednesday 11am as I have to be down there early for an unrelated ISAW issue.. I should be able to manage this on the way up here but now that I'm thinking about.. I have another place I have to be at 12pm.. Rohan is going to take the mouse down now and see if he can't get a replacement today. In the meantime i've gone ahead and added a temporary mouse.</p>
