<p>I'll take a look, unfortunately my sense of time and memory aren't the best right now. I clearly remember backing the full machine up after I installed everything but it's likely something went amiss or I didn't finish. That would be extremely unusual but I've been putting my phone in the freezer so it's possible I missed this.&nbsp;</p>
