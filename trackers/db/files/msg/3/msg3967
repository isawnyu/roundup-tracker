The updater seems to be for iTunes. It will not take any login and password combination I have. I am also have mobile me problems, so I am getting error messages all day long. I can log in to my mobile me on my home computer and this computer, but it will not pick up my personal calendar as it did before and when I log in, it still says I have the wrong user name/password.
