<p>The current situation with wireless on the 1st and 2nd floors is poor. Connectivity is poor as well as general wireless signal strength. NYU downtown has conducted a survey but I'm not sure what or if that will produce much as it was just a survey. In the meantime we critically need proper connectivity for the lecture hall, library and the on the 1st floor for exhibitions (especially for iphones, ipods, ipads and any other mobile device). Everyone has commented on the poor signal strength and the general slowness and it will become more of a detriment with time.</p>
<p>I'm recommended that we purchase a separate wireless access point with the callname "nyu-isaw" this will be explicitly a backup for these two floors until the connectivity situation is remedied.</p>

<p>When the wireless connectivity issue is remedied this device can always be used for backup should there ever be a problem elsewhere through-out the building and/or if the problem seems to be reoccuring. It's much cheaper than an aironet and for our current needs we can place it behind the security desk in the front.</p>
