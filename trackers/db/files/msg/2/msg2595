Dear Chris,

The Lacie2Big hard drive, which is generally connected to the Scanner1 and Scanner2 computers on the 4th floor, is no longer connected to Scanner2. The computer registers the presence of the hard drive, but it cannot be opened or moved. Unfortunately, all of the work for the image bank is stored there, so Irene Soto cannot help me with AWIB tasks without that connection. Thanks for your time.

Best,
Nate
