do you need power for laptops?  a building request should be made for furniture.  otherwise no problem, but we will need to hook up the laptop being used 20-30 minutes in advance as that projector requires positioning/focus being set.  I usually set up the projector on the east end of the room in front of the fireplace, let me know if this is acceptable.
