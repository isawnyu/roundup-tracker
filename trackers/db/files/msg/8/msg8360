<p class="p1">I've recently learned that NYU has a contract for "personal computer maintenance and repair services" with an outfit called "Computer Network Solutions" (CNS). We're obligated to check them out first to see if they can do it:</p>

<p class="p1">(search in page for CNS)</p>
<p class="p1">Note that we'll also have to dispose of the old hard drives in accordance with NYU computer surplus process (which I also only just found out about):&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/asset/Restricted/surplus-computer.html"><span class="s2">http://www.nyu.edu/asset/Restricted/surplus-computer.html</span></a>&nbsp;. CNS is the vendor of choice for sanitizing NYU drives, you'll notice.</p>
<p class="p1">Let me know if CNS says they can't do this or, if they do, about next steps.</p>
