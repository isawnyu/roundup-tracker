<p>It has been several weeks since lights were replaced, despite my pointing out various lights that are out, such as a sconce light on 4, over the student carrels. Could we please have the bi-weekly light replacement implemented that we've long been promised? I should not need to put light outages on tickets to get them replaced.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, Diane</p>
