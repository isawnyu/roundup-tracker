Michael,

I am leaving for Germany on business today. Yesterday, I received a warning about my email password expiring and that I had to change it.  I did on sitemail. Now my blackberry is not receiving emails.  I have tried to follow instruction to change it on my device, go to email settings, enter password, but there is an error message, I then tried to go on the web.  I don't know my user name or password to get onto my black berry web page.  Is it possible for you to send me this information? I am going to be lost with a bb this week...Thanks so much,

Jennifer
