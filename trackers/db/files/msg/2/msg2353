This morning a listserv member sent out a message on the list. The success rate was 89 out of 90. The one permanent failure reported may be an out-of-date email address; I'm looking into that. I've also emailed two regular failing recipients to make quite sure they got this latest mailing. But it does look as if the fix of the system-wide problem might have done something for this longer-standing local one.
