For health reasons I will have to work from home for roughly a month. Since I am currently developing the checklist of ISAW next exhibition I need to be able to open the checklist from home but my personal computer does not have the program File Maker. Therefore, I either need a copy of the file that could be installed (even only temporarily) on my computer, or to borrow an ISAW laptop with the program installed.
Thank for the help you could provide
