<p>Subject: can't find news item draft<br />Date: Wed, 2 Nov 2011 12:44:24 -0400<br />From: Whitney Steen &lt;wls3@nyu.edu&gt;<br />To: Tom Elliott &lt;tom.elliott@nyu.edu&gt;</p>
<p>Tom,</p>
<p>I set up my news blurb on Monday and then just got time to upload the newsletter file today and now I can't find the draft of my news item anywhere (it was just an internal draft, I hadn't submitted it for review). Is there some place specific I should be looking?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Whitney</p>
