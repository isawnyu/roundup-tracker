<p>Where in the room do you want new ports, assuming cost and number are no object? I have a meeting tomorrow morning (16 November) with the telecom folks to see how we get a cost estimate. I suspect they'll try to go all the way from process description to discovery, so it would help to have a description of what we want. You're welcome to join us if you think you can spare the half-hour and that would be faster than you describing it in an email or an append to this ticket before then. Let me know if you want an invite to the meeting.</p>
