Dear Michael,

I was assigned an NYU NetID in the fall.  However, the form that I was given by ISAW was for appointment through June, even though the actual letter of appointment was for three years.  I guess the whole account has expired and I'll have to start from scratch; the NYUNetID I was given was kr987 but who knows what will happen if I have to start over. I don't know who is around at ISAW to help with this.   Is it possible to have access through the karensr@pipeline notation until I get the formal process worked out?  

thanks.
Karen
