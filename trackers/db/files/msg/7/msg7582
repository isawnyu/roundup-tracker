<p>I'm dropping this off with secure data recovery today, it'll take 2-3 business days for a follow-up. Essentially they are thinking it can be a maximum of $2500 USD to recover the drive if there is just nothing that they can do. On the low end it could be anywhere from $400-$1000 USD. They'll provide the evaluation and let us know, at that point you can make a decision on what exactly you'd like to do.</p>
