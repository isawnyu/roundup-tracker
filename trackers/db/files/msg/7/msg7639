<p>Unfortunately, installation of new operating system has produced major catastrophe: Parallels refuses to work, so I have no access to my financial information. When Parallels starts, I get a message saying "Your virtual machine may run slow because virtualization support is disabled on your Mac. For optimal performance, please enable hardware virtualization support in your Mac's firmware." Once one says "OK" to this bit of gibberish (searching Help on the Mac for virtualization produces no results), a message comes up "Unable to load the Parallels driver. Restart your Mac and try again." Of course, restarting does not actually help.</p>
