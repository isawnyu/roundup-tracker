Hi Christopher, I tried to use the scanner n the 4th floor, punching in my code, 3699, as I do for photocopying, but then the scan needs to be sent to my email. There is no "box" or button with my name that I can press and so email the scan to me. I see (nearly) everyone elses' name but not mine :^( Thanks for your help, Judith
