March 9th 1:15-2:00 pm.

Phone interview between Mehrnoush Soroush (Iran) and the ISAW graduate search committee (Roger Bagnall, Alexander Jones, Beate Pongratz-Leisten).

We require a stable connection for a group phone interview. Soroush has access to a dial-up connection only. 

It is very important that we are able to begin the interview promplty.
