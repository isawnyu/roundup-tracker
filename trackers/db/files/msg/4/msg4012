I\'m not sure if this should be a new ticket or piggybacked onto my last one. my new Mac is now hooked up to ISAW wifi, but I still don\'t seem to be able to print. Christopher set me up with both 4th and 6th-floor printers, but I couldn\'t print yesterday. Didn\'t have my Mac with me today and won\'t be in until Friday,  but would sure like to be able to print then. I should be around all day-if not at my carrel,5-2, then in Soeren\'s office, working with a colleague who is using it while Soeren\'s away. I\'ve marked it \"high\" for Friday. Thanks, Judith
