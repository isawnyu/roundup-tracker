No, the blue screen stayed there for more than an hour before I forced shutdown. Same thing happened on all attempts to boot until I remembered about "safe mode" booting. I'm hoping the problem has miraculously vanished, but we'll see. Meanwhile Michael is supposed to have ordered me a new, bigger drive, but I don't know what the status of that is now.
