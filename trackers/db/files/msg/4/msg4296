Dear Chris,
I have started collecting and scanning articles that I may need to use as teaching material for Prof. Bagnall's academic program in Egypt this Fall. This is related to my current appointment as research associate and, after the Summer, to my new appointment as clinical assistant professor of Archaeology at ISAW/NYU. It happened that one long article that I scanned on the machine in the library at ISAW (and that I sent to myself as an email attachment) was delivered as a folder with separate .pdf files (one per page) rather than one file (which would be much better for my purposes). Dawn told me that there is a licensed version of Acrobat here at the institute and suggested that I contact you to see if it is possible to have that installed on my machine (so that I can easily combine .pdf files into one).
Many thanks and have a great day!
Nico
