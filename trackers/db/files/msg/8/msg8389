<p>Is just acting very odd, i'm not sure if it's because it needs a round of updates or what. The updates to my knowledge should be automatic but I didn't get time to really diagnose properly. I'll carve out sometime to do this most likely tomorrow, if only because it is frustrating to have to respond to a seemingly two minute issue and waste time updating for an hour.</p>
<p>Roger has a way of finding a small crevice and turning it into a wide gaping hole. What's even more interesting is that it occurs with normal use. I'm going to cc isaw.it@nyu.edu to several update list if only to stay ahead of these issues that can be solved that way. As well as to keep more eyeballs on problems that may begin to surface as I only have a pair.</p>
