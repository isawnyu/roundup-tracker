So I suspect Diane is speaking about the Growl setting in system preferences that can be turned off for the Skype application. The notice that pops up resembles.. &quot;X user has signed on&quot; etc. I also suspect this will become a problem for other apps so I'm recommending Growl be turned off in its entirety as this seems to be a severe annoyance for her. I will turn this setting off on Monday Feb 28, 2011 sometime during the morning and will summarily be closing this ticket out.
