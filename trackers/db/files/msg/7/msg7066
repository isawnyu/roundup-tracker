<p>As an update here this is actually a known bug affecting all Apple machines since 10.4. It involves the CYMK palette and jpegs and I'm not exactly sure why it hasn't been fixed by now. The only work around which I could think of is to switch the color palette to an RGB profile and saving the file, which is what I had to do for these sets of images.This is a very interesting bug however and analysis could possibly prove useful and it's also very highly likely that this is a filesystem issue.</p>
