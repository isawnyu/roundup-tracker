Michael:

When you can grab a few minutes now and then, please start taking notes on batch tasks (like getting IPs, passwords for wiki, etc) that are likely to be annual events in fall when we get new groups of students and scholars. Capture what you can in the way of lessons learned, how-to, etc. and look at incorporating same into the IT master manual.

This, of course, is lower priority than specific help-people tasks, but in so far as you can find time for it, I think it would be time well spent.

Best,
Tom
