Hi Tim,

We started talking about getting me a working ArcGIS install again before the holidays. I thought it best to open a ticket. Basically, I've got an install from the CD you sent me last spring (marked Student License or some such, and saying something about a one-year license). But it says on launch that it's expired and won't function.

I'm probably going to need a working copy of this by next month, so if we could figure out what current NYU site-licensing is, that would be useful. Crazy expensive to buy ourselves.

Let me know if there's something I can do to push forward the process.

Best,
Tom
