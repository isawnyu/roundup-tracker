In monitoring the leak today, I note that the closest downspout visible from he window where the library component of the building abuts the building to the west is blocked. During heavy rain, water is cascading down the side of the ISAW building, and during light rain the downspout has water running down the outside.

Sorry for the imprecision, I can show you where this is.
