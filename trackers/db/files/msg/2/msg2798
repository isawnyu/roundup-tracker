When Linda tries to print from Iphoto to the 5th floor HP Color Laserjet it fails with an onerous message:

ERROR: limitcheck
OFFENDING COMMAND: image
STACK:

The problem seems to be Iphoto.

Linda the work around is that you have to save the modified images you are working with and then print them out using preview. 

I'll update after I walk through this process with Linda herself.
