Hi Mike,

Friday morning, the conference will be starting at 8:30am. When Dwayne comes in in the morning, I would like him to set up one of the folding tables at the entrance that we can use as a check-in table. I'd like it set up by 7:45am. Later in the day, we'll then need it moved to the second floor (about 11am). Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kate
