I just got off the phone with Steve Salem at Apple 2:42pm.

I've made an appointment for the Upper West Side store at 12:45pm on Wednesday after explaining the issue. Steve recommended that should there be any issues at all for any reason to call back and ask to speak to Customer Relations. Tell them the case number which is case # 177345106 and to have a replacement laptop sent out immediately.
