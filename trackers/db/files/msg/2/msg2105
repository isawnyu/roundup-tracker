Hi,

I was trying to help Gilles Bransbourg email himself something from the scanner on the third floor copier and he doesn't appear to be listed anymore.  We looked in all the pages under "Frequent" and also tried the alphabetized listings but could not find him.  As he is staying on for another academic year could someone please check that he is in the copier and, if he is, let me know how to locate his option. (If it's the latter, I'd like to know where to look just in case this happens to someone else.)

Thanks,
Whitney
