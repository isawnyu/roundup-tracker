The PDF does not provide enough information to completely fill out the registration wizard. For the ArcView single license, I'm prompted for: "arcview registration number", "time-out date", "version", "authorization code 1", "authorization code 2" and "validation code". There is no date information in the PDF. Nor are the various columns labeled. I can guess at a couple, but there's not enough information to complete all fields on the form. I've tried various combinations, but when clicking the "next" button I get errors like "the authorization code 2 is invalid for ArcView (single use)".
