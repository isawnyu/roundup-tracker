We will need the Oak Library set up for orientation on September 2 and 3.  This should include seating for 30 people in the front half of the room with the rest of the furniture moved to accommodate -- seating can be a mix of silver chairs and existing library furniture, whatever works best.

Additionally, we would like Duane to be here on Wednesday, September 2nd in the evening in order to clean after the dinner that is being held from 7-8 -- if he is able to stay it would involve being here until 10 at the latest, and he could come in late or take a break to make the hours work.

Thank you in advance and we apologize for the short notice!
