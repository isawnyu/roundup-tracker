<p>Hi Lillian:</p>
<p>I think this is coming from the central NYU record-keeping system. If you search for "Tseng" with the "people" option on the search box at <a href="http://www.nyu.edu">http://www.nyu.edu</a>, you get an entry as follows:</p>
<h4 class="fn" title="lyt4">Lan-Ying Tseng</h4>

<p class="contactInformation"><span class="title">Associate Professor</span><br /><span class="org">New York University</span>&nbsp;<br /><span class="email"><a href="mailto:lillian.tseng@nyu.edu">lillian.tseng@nyu.edu</a></span></p>
<p class="contactInformation"><span class="email">This is not something that Christopher or I have access to change; in fact, I can't even see how to change one's name via the NYU home "preferences" link. </span></p>
<p class="contactInformation"><span class="email">I fear you'll need to open a ticket with ITS to find out how or whether this is possible. Please send them an email like the one you sent me via askits@nyu.edu. Feel free to copy isaw.it@nyu.edu if you like so we see the initial response.</span></p>
<p class="contactInformation"><span class="email">Best,</span></p>
<p class="contactInformation"><span class="email">Tom</span></p>
<p class="contactInformation"><span class="email">I'm marking this ticket closed since we don't have the capacity to resolve this situation for you as it involves systems managed downtown.</span></p>
