<p>I don't remember if I forwarded this to you before the break or not. <br />Either way, here it is. I'd like to see a full workup of needs and costs <br />by the time I return from the field season at the end of February.</p>

<p>Dear Roger,</p>
<p>after talks and e-mailing with the other colleagues I present you some<br />notes on the "archaeo-station" for ISAW.</p>
<p>Hardware<br />Chris and Soeren would prefer a Mac, For me PC or Mac is not relevant.<br />But if a mac, then we must be sure it is able to run all applications<br />we want to put on it. Chris maintains that it takes possibly more<br />work, but it is absolutely possible to put all software mentioned<br />below also on Mac.<br />An A3 scan-device is also needed. The costs of it vary, but now there<br />are very good ones at very low prices.<br />To be more accurate, we could consider to buy also a graphic tablet.<br />We can discuss about this point at a later stage, it is not urgent.</p>
<p>Software<br />General consensus on AutoCAD and the Adobe Suite, MSoffice and Indesign.<br />General interest on ArcGIS; also Harris Matrix Composer and SPSS<br />(statistics program) have been suggested.</p>
<p>I submit now this short inquiry to your consideration, so that you<br />have in any case all the elements to discuss it with Chris (and Tom?)<br />in terms of feasibility and coasts.</p>
<p>Have a good w-e,</p>
<p>Lorenzo</p>
