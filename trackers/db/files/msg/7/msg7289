<p>In response to your question via email (copied below into the ticket for completeness): yes, each "seat" (i.e., user/computer) for which we install Filemaker Pro must have its own license and the cost of each such license is $170. That is a university-negotiated license price, significantly less than the commerical list price of $299/copy.</p>
<p>Please let us know how you would like to proceed.</p>
