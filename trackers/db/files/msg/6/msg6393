<p>For the new powerbook I just received (bought on IDP3) funds, I need licensed copies of Office and Adobe Creative Suite (or whatever: I need Acrobat, Illustrator and Photoshop). Do we have licenses available for these or do I need to order additional licenses? Either way, I should probably have media here locally, rather than being dependent on copies in NYC, no?</p>
