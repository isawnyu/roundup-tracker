<p>To my knowledge and from my own recollection, and you'll have to pardon me because my memory is normally foggy, so if I'm wrong I apologize. Wednesday November 16th and 12pm EST we had a discussion about the needs for room 605-606 in regards to network jacks being installed on the north, east and southern walls. I don't believe you were apart of this discussion but the gist is that we needed 8 ports per wall for approximately $3912 USD. We then followed up with confirmation for a quick survey of the room and closets to make sure that there were no hidden costs and that we could proceed etc.</p>
<p>We set the date for December 7th 2011 at 11 am EST, that was yesterday. Unfortunately no one ever showed up so i'm not sure what happened or if there was some miscommunication about the date. However, we'd like to move forward and see this through to resolution. What steps should I or someone at ISAW take to get this work done?</p>
