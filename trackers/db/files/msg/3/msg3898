One cannot connect to iChat even when they authenticate against the Jabber server.

This is due to a bug in Apple 10.6.5 server on update it modifies the hostname of service configurations. More information is here I don't have time to report or debug with Apple. The remedy is to simply add the correct hostname to the ichat service.

Someone needs to debug and send the information to the jabber team here https://launchpad.net/jabberd2

As well as reporting to Apple, if you need to choose report to the current Tomasz Sterna instead of Apple and pray that they pull from upstream.
