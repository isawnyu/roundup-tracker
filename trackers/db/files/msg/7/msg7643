<p>Registration is normally for the user. What I try do when I install a package is register it to the general ISAW account or the users nyu email address but that is taken great liberty. Also each user is different so if relevant updates and notices that will be important to the user are coming to isaw.it@nyu.edu or to an email they don't have access to read or if it's generally ignored that helps no one. I should really probably stop that practice.</p>
<p>In your specific case, the password is the same password for your computer. Mac OS display an administrator dialog anytime you make changes, or update anything in the system. The password is the same administrator password. If you're talking about a password for the virtual machine in specific I doubt Ben would have selected anything different from that as well.</p>
