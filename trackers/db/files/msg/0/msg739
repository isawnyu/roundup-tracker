Duane:

Could you please help clean up the second  floor kitchen tomorrow. Please see the email from Jessica below; there are ants in the kitchen apparently. Thanks...

Hi Suzan,

I didn't want to bother you, but I wanted to let you know about the situation in the kitchen.  I was just down there getting the tea ready, and there are ants crawling all over the counter, and the dishwasher seems to be plugged/backed up.  I don't know who is the appropriate person to talk to about these concerns. 

I imagine this will only get worse after the reception tonight, so if there is any way someone could go in and clean up tomorrow morning, that would be really helpful.  I am happy to load dishes and tidy up, but I would rather not have to do major cleaning in there tonight or tomorrow.

Until we can get the dishwasher working, I will have to use paper plates and cups for the coffee and tea service - I hope that's alright.  If we don't do that, the kitchen is quickly going to get out of control with dirty dishes (and we don't have enough to keep using china without being able to wash it).

I'm sorry to throw all of this at you, but I wasn't sure what the appropriate channel would be.

Thanks,
Jess
