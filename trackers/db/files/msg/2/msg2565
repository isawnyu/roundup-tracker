Hi Michael:

Roger has requested that we set up a calendar in which major elements of Shelby's travel schedule (and other major conflicts) can be tracked. Does Shelby already have an account and a calendar? If not, can we set one up?

We'll then need to follow up with Shelby and probably with her administrative assistant at the foundation to figure out how information will get put in and maintained. I'll want to be part of that latter process.

Thanks,
Tom
