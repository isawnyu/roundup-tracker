<p>Kate:</p>
<p>I can't figure out how to do this. Content in the people folders doesn't behave the way content does in regular sections of the website. I assume this has to do with the way Christopher has coded the on-the-fly categorization of people into the different sections. I'm going to have to hand this issue off to him. Since he's out of the office this week, it will have to be deferred until he returns. Marking it back to "unread" so it shows up in his queue.</p>
<p>Apologies,</p>
