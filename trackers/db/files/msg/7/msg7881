<p>After a full wipe and restore of the machine the security issues are gone. The machine can finally update and install drivers and programs properly etc. However the printer is still not working. It's rather unfortunate but it seems that the Windows 7 driver doesn't work with the printer and the old Vista driver can't be installed. This means that the printer is probably fully functional but Dell needs to update the driver. The driver that they claim works for Windows 7, does in-fact not work with Windows 7.</p>
<p>What i'm going to do is grab the 3rd floor printer and proceed there, in the meantime all of Mikes all programs have to be reinstalled and the machine has to be rejoined to the Ulysses network. Tomorrow I'm going to call Joe around 11am and setup a remote session so he can do this as it cannot be done from an external network. From there we then need to make sure all of Mike's old programs and documents are installed and restored. Virus software has already been installed but needs to be indexed and reran etc etc. I expect another day or two on this alone.</p>
