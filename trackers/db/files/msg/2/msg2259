Lidewijde,

Thanks for sending along your NYU Net ID. Your NYU NetID is primarily used to log on to the wireless network across the University. You now have a separate but similar account ID for services at ISAW.

Your ISAW copier code is:
00031

Your ISAW account credentials are:
User Name: ldj3
Password: 00031

These account credentials will allow you to sign on to the ISAW wiki located at http://serv1.isaw.nyu.edu. It is also used to set up calendaring, the address book, and instant messaging.

Instructions for setting up these services are located at http://serv1.isaw.nyu.edu/groups/isaw/wiki/64ef5/ISAW_Services_Setup_Matrix.html

Mac minis are available in the library on the fourth and fifth floors if you need an internet connection.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions by opening another ticket. I will be out of the office through next week but available remotely for help.

Best regards,
Michael Edgcumbe
ISAW IT
