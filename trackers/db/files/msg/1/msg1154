Gilles:

As I mentioned in my orientation session, Michael only works for us part-time. I'm sending you separately a note I sent to our internal listserv about his hours; apparently you are not subscribed to that list. I'm taking steps to get the subscription up-to-date so you will have timely information about internal events. I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience. I will also send you separately some information about using the &quot;Guest wireless&quot; capability. This should get you through today and through the weekend until Michael can contact you on Monday to set a time to do the formal, NYU connection.

Best,
Tom
