Tim:

I've given the following "high" priority because Roger has told me that this project is his top priority for me right now.

The following is the advice I got from Melitte Buchman about hardware and software to support our "ISAW Images" project. I need to get Roger an itemized cost list so he can allocate funds to procure what we need.

Would you please react to the following, indicating whether you think Melitte has told us everything we need. In particular, could you:

1. Investigate how many copies/licenses we need of the color calibration software, assuming that both the student's computer, Roger's computer(s) and your computer will need to be calibrated for color. I think we should calibrate all the computers Roger might use to look at this stuff.

2. What upgrades do we need to the scanner computer to support this work? I'm thinking it would be good to get a 2TB dual-disk RAID on which to store all the images as he's working (safety first, right?). A second fast disk might be good as scratch space for Photoshop, since it's such a hog and there's a big performance hit doing scratch on the startup volume. Also, do we need more RAM?

3. Can you verify pricing on the scanner, software and hardware?

Please let me know what you think and if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Tom

It was nice speaking with you.  Here's a link for the slide scanner that I think would be best for your project.  If you are sure that the professor doesn't have any LARGER FORMAT slides, like 21/4 (also known as 120mm) or 4x5 transparencies, then the cheaper scanner (the Coolscan 5000 ED)will be fine, just be aware that it only accepts 35mm slides  $1000

b&h is already in NYU's ibuy system so that may make things easier for you

click on the accessories tab:
If you buy the Coolscan 5000 you should buy this software (Silverfast) which manages the color correctly $300

You will want a fairly frisky computer to run this.  I prefer MACs but the slide scanner will run on either platform.  I'd suggest a good deal of RAM and either a dual or quad core.  Let me know if you'd like me to spec this out for you.

Also needed for TEMPORARY storage, must have USB2 connections, firewire would be nice too:
a small extreme drive (250GB okay) for transport - the lacie is nice
a reasonable external drive for capture (500GB-1 TB best) for capture and TEMPORARY storage - I prefer G tech or western digital
NYU computer store has quite good prices on these.
