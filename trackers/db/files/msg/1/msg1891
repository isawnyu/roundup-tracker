dear Michael,

If we can try to set up my computer tomorrow (may 4th) in the beginning of the afternoon, that would be great. If it works tomorrow, it will work in 2 weeks. I'm not sure when I'll be at ISAW on the 18th - I have some meetings downtown. Otherwise, we can also plan to set it up around 5:30 pm on the 18th.
let me know,
best,
caroline
