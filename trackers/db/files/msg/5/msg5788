<p>I just reset your printer setup for the 4th floor copier. I also added added a backup device named LANIER MP 3500/LD335 PS that will print through a different protocol for the 4th floor copier. Unfortunately I can't rename it, because this is how it's been setup via the firmware.</p>
<p>That aside, please try again and let me know. I printed test pages to insure it was indeed working but they weren't pdf's so please update.</p>
