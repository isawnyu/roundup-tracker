Alex,

The latest version of Parallels that runs on 10.5 is version 5.  We would need to purchase two additional copies to add to your machine.  In this case, Tiffany advises that we must charge your research budget.

Each license of Parallels runs $80.  We are also able to get Windows 7 Home Professional upgrades for $60 each.  Please let me know how many copies of each you're interested in purchasing at this time.

Thanks,
Michael
