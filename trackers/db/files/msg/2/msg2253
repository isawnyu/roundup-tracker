Seth,

Thanks for sending along your NYU Net ID. Your NYU NetID is primarily used to log on to the wireless network across the University. You now have a separate but similar account ID for services at ISAW.

Your ISAW copier code is:
5952

Your ISAW account credentials are:
User Name: ss5952
Password: 5952

These account credentials will allow you to sign on to the ISAW wiki located at http://serv1.isaw.nyu.edu. It is also used to set up calendaring, the address book, and instant messaging.

Instructions for setting up these services are located at http://serv1.isaw.nyu.edu/groups/isaw/wiki/64ef5/ISAW_Services_Setup_Matrix.html

Mac minis are available in the library on the fourth and fifth floors if you need an internet connection immediately.  It seems you are having trouble with accepting the security certificate used by NYU for the wireless networks.  How you accept this ticket depends on which operating system you are using.  Instructions for each OS can be found by clicking through the links at the bottom of this page: http://www.nyu.edu/its/wireless/configure/

The only network you should be using is 'nyu.'  NYU-ROAM networks are deprecated and should not be used.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions by opening another ticket on this issue. I will be out of the office until next week but available remotely for help.  Help is also available from NYU ITS Client Services by calling 212-998-3333.

Best regards,
Michael Edgcumbe
ISAW IT
