<p>For some reason, my Macbook Air's version of Word periodically refuses to open files that people send me with .doc extensions. Instead, I get a little "convert from" dialog screen, which makes no sense at all, and no choice I make there ever produces anything except gibberish. I know that the files themselves are OK--I opened one this morning on my old PC, and it was fine--so the problem lies somewhere in the version of Word on my laptop. But as far as I know that is up to date and normal, so I am completely baffled. Neither opening through the Word menu nor direct clicking on the file produces any better result. Any ideas on what is causing this problem? BTW, renaming the file .docx doesn't help.</p>
