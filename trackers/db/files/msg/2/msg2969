The new ISAW digital camera and battery charger have arrived.  Whitney put both in the IT office, in the drawer where the laptops are stored.  She looked at them to make sure they arrived in one piece, but I'd be grateful if one of you guys could fire it all up and make sure it works (so we can make a ruckus and return it if it doesn't).

Many thanks,
Tom
