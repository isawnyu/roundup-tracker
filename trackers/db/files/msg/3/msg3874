Hi Mike,

A few minutes ago, I tried to take a loaded book truck from the 3rd floor to the 2nd floor and discovered that the elevator was not working.  Had I received notification that the elevator would be out of service for some amount of time this afternoon, I could have planned the workflow better.  

Thanks,
Dawn
