<p>Hi Scott: <br /> <br />On 9/17 we issued an iBuy Purchase Order (EW425119) for 20 seats of the OSX Lion volume license. If there's been any follow-up email sent requesting more info or providing transmittal information, it's gone astray. <br /> <br />Can you help us sort out what's happened to this order? <br /> <br />Thanks, <br />Tom&nbsp;</p>
