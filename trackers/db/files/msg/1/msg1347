Dear Mike,

As you requested yesterday, I inquired about the number of participants for the reception on Nov 17, 6-8 PM. We will have at least 100 people. I kindly ask that the room be set up as it was for the opening reception; all the furniture, except the 2 large couches, 2 large tables and 2 cabinets  removed to the 6th floor. 

Thank you,
Irene
