Michael:

Could you arrange, with Mike K.'s help if necessary, to get measurements of the seminar room wall area so we can size possible projector screens? I need to circulate a draft plan next week to the faculty and senior staff before presenting it to John B. etc. at the next building meeting.

Thanks,
Tom
