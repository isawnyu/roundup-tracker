Jacco,

NYU provides instructions to set up the wireless network on the ITS website.  http://www.nyu.edu/its/wireless/configure/#instructions

We can assist you if you have trouble following these instructions.  

In order to provide you with access to the setup videos created by ISAW IT, we need to create an ISAW IT account for you.  Our accounts are based on a naming convention that uses your NYU NetID and a password generated from it.  Please reply to this message with the link provided below with your NYU NetID.

Best regards,
Michael Edgcumbe
ISAW IT
