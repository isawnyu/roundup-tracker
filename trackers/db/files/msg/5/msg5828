<p>This is complete, applecare added and the machine put into Jennifer's office. Due to the new keyboard and setup, Jennifer may want her old keyboard and mouse back. The mouse operates based on touch and gestures you perform on top of it. They keyboard is wireless and smaller. I realize this may take some getting used to.</p>
<p>Due to this and the upgraded calendar application. I'm going to upgrade Irene to Lion next week sometime as well, including keyboard as we have an extra one.</p>
