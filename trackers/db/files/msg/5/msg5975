<p>This understanding of Bonjour/Zeroconf is correct what I am asking is if a dedicated server machine is connected to two interfaces via the wireless and wired network and one uses a printer daemon to share printers via the added computer you are saying this breaks policy? Besides the above which I can wholeheartedly agree with and fully understand. Bridging or in essence, sharing printers via this method doesn't affect NYU-NET at all. I mean there is nothing effectively routing any traffic at that point. The computer would pick up the Bonjour broadcast and the daemon would share the printers locally at ISAW. Is there some other reason this is against policy?</p>
<p>Have you inquired with other system administrators regarding system<br />management and/or policy management on a wide-group of machines?<br />Through various discussions with other system administrators as well<br />as ITS folks, I believe there should be other solutions that can help<br />resolve the configuration of multiple machines. Specifically, Jorge<br />Najera-Ordonez deals with systems deployed across NYC as well as<br />various global sites, his group's deployment history and current<br />knowledge of system/policy management may help solve this problem as<br />well. I've CC'd jorge on this message so he may help provide any<br />guidance.</p>
<p>Multiple machines are only involved here in having to configure our scholars laptops every time we have a new set of scholars at ISAW. This isn't a puppet, server or dedicated terminal setup. So if we receive 15-20 new scholars every semester that's inputting printer config for their laptop machines repeatedly. Whilst using Bonjour only simple instruction on how to add a printer is necessary, if that.</p>
<p>Feel free to call me to discuss any of this further; we definitely<br />don't want to seem like a hinderance in making your systems easier to<br />manage!</p>
<p>Definitely, i'd love to find a solution that doesn't involve manually inputting the ip address of our printers.</p>
