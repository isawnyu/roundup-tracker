<p>I would just like to clarify that I did not have any objections about <br />the form being too complicated for internal users (assuming we are <br />talking about the form revisions we discussed in April). My objection <br />was on the back end -- if I have to go in and manually retrieve the <br />information every time someone just wants to use a conference room for <br />an hour, I'd rather let them continue to email me directly as it will <br />save time. I would LOVE to be able to direct traffic through the form, <br />but for internal purposes it is inefficient to have to go retrieve <br />information from a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Kate will have to weigh in on whether it is worth it to have external <br />events run through the form. Our intention was to make sure we could <br />get all the information about a proposed event at once instead of having <br />to exchange several emails, so perhaps the retrieval from the <br />spreadsheet is not as inefficient in that case.</p>
