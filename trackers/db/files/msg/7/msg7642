<p>Yes, thanks, that worked. But somewhat more complicated: when Parallels was installed on my machine, an account was set up (with a password not selected by me, thus unknown), but the program was not registered. This is why (I think) it never told me that an update was needed. When programs are installed, shouldn't they be registered? </p>
