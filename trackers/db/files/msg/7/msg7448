<p>Leif Isaksen and Eric Kansa (plus two other GAP people) are here and I tried getting them on guest wi-fi. Connecting to nyuguest is no problem, and the log-in page comes up as expected. But entering guest401 and this week's password give ~"incorrect password". This is on a bunch of different machines, etc. so I do think there is an issue.</p>
<p>I'm guessing it's a "downtown" problem (Chuck notes that the Library systems had a failure this weekend so maybe related?) but perhaps it's a local equipment/other failure so I report it here.</p>
<p>Thanks. -Sebastian</p>
