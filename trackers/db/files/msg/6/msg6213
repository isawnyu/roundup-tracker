<p style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">I have a couple questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">Can Mike get a version of this ticket system that only shows (or sorts to the top) the building items?&nbsp; It seems like he has to wade through a lot of IT tickets to see what is open for the buidling.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">Also, I used to get e-mails when there were building tickets but I con't get them anymore - can I start getting them again.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">I would also like access to this new system - do I have it?&nbsp; Perhaps someone could walk me through the log in procedure again.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">Thanks for your help with these requests.</p>
