Hi Irene,

Just to interject here on the naming alias. I am not sure if you did this or Tom did this yet but for the most part we want our aliases to be the same. The convention we are using is to keep everything with a simple . so isaw.it@nyu.edu or isaw.library@nyu.edu. 

If this hasn't been done yet i'll send in the request as I'd rather it be done correctly the first time. If there is a problem it's likely to be dropped or caught up in a back and forth. I'd like to avoid that.
