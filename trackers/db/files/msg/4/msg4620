So the above is more expensive and a little shorter than the below but includes a signal regenerator which is useful for a cable at such length and will make sure even if there is interference along the baseboards that Tiffany can print. So I recommend the above, the bottom one may work and is provided as an option if we want to save 10 USD or so but at 39ft it's a gamble.
