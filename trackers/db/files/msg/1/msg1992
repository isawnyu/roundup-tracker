Mike,

The faculty would like to attach a hook to the bottom of the seminar room table at the end closest to the TV to keep to monitor cables off the ground and within reach.  Could we find something that they could slip through (a carabiner, etc)?  The idea is to keep people from having to crawl under the table to plug stuff in.

Thanks,
Michael
