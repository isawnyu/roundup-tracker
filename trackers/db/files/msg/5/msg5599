<p>You're free to set this up at anytime, it involves pushing a button and plugging in the laptop. I don't plan to be in the building until a little before my 15 minute spiel and we most likely won't have any other IT support on hand. I realize the auspice of this duty may seem IT related but realistically turning on a projector and plugging in a laptop should be simple enough for faculty and staff.<br /><br />I will check the projector sometime this week to be sure it's operating halfway decently.&nbsp;</p>
