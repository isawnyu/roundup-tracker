I can't find an open ticket on this, though both Whitney and Roger claim they put one in. The color printer is not able to be accessed by Whitney, Roger or Alex. Whitney rebooted it and nothing changed. Roger is anxious to print out boarding passes, etc. 
If this is a duplicate of other tickets, please close.
