For some reason my computer is not letting me print to the 5th floor color printer. I can print to the 6th floor, 4th floor and 4th floor color, but not the 5th floor. It says I need to download software, but it already shows up as installed. Not sure what I need to do. Also, my calendar isn't syncing, I think because my password is not in there anymore. I can't remember what it is, so if I can get that resent, that would be great. 

Also, I really  need to get access to my html files for e-blasts on Monday. Is there another computer in the building that has dreamweaver installed so I can put some together?

Thank you!
