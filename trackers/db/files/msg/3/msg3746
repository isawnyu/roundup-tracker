I've updated the recommendations and will ask key personnel (via email) to respond to the following suggestions:

1. 27&quot; iMac with 2.8GHz quad core Intel i5 processor, 16GB RAM, 1TB SATA drive, 256GB SSD, Apple Magic Mouse, Apple Care

2. Question for Tiffany: do you want the Apple Wireless Keyboard (http://www.apple.com/keyboard/) or the Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad (http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB110LL/A)?

3. Second 27&quot; external monitor. Best price-for-value (given that real-estate, not movies is the main criterion) via CDW NYU contract is the Planar PX2710MW 27&quot; LCD: http://www.planar.com/products/flatpanel_monitors/px2710mw/

4. Adapter for monitor

5. 2TB External hard drive for dedicated Time Machine backup. WDBAAF0020BK. Same model as we just bought for Alex.

6. Dedicated printer. On sale (through today only!) at CDW, we can get $100 off an HP LaserJet P2055dn, which handles legal and letter paper, 1200 dots-per-inch monochrome printing at 35 ppm and can be connected with either USB or ethernet. This could double as a convenience/confidential printer for Diane and Tiffany together.

This all falls within the $3,978 budget we have for this purchase. Selections above save us enough on the external printer, monitor and external hard drive that we can spring for the extra cost of the SSD in the iMac, which should give us a bit more reliability and speed in terms of OS performance.

Thoughts?
