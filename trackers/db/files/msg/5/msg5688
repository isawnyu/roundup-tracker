<p>It would be good to move the display of our news content (both in the individual items and in the public-facing collection at&nbsp;<a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/news/">http://isaw.nyu.edu/news/</a>) to look more like blog entries. Allowing anonymous viewers to see bylines and "last modified" datetimes would go a long way in that direction.</p>
