Michael:

The fledgling ISAW digital publishing effort needs to pre-order and purchase an iPad. Roger has cleared the expense (I'll forward emails shortly). We need this as soon as possible (as far in advance as possible of a 19 April demo to the ISAW advisory board). The primary point of contact for questions and use is Sebastian Heath (sebastian.heath@gmail.com). 

Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,
Tom
