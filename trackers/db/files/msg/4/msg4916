We have an initial dump of the data from the ticket system in the new ticket system.

Next step is to finese the data so the variables are precise and the creation dates etc are accurate. From there I will create temporary user accounts and finish visual cleanups. Add row high lighting and fix the email template. At that point I will create ticket.isaw.nyu.edu and begin setting up the server processes.
