I re-organized the first floor kitchen on Friday, and as a result there is a large pile of old cardboard boxes and also some trash over by the refrigerator which need to be disposed of.

Also, could we please get a small garbage can in that room?  Exhibitions will be using the counter space as they install the new exhibition starting Nov. 2 and they will need some place to throw away any trash.

Thanks,
Whitney
