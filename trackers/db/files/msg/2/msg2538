Diane would like her access to wiki, copier, printer, etc. set up as soon as practical. Her netid is db142. She also needs advice from Michael on how best to take over Suzan's old machine and reconfigure. And she wants to make sure that a full copy of Suzan's files are stored and accessible to her and Tiffany (they will need a demo on how to get to it).

Please contact Diane as soon as possible to arrange things.
