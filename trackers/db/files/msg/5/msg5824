<p>If you own the content it will put it into review mode but that doesn't stop you from publishing it. Review mode as the owner of a piece of content is so that you actually review it before submitting it externally.</p>
<p>So for example, you are working on something, you submit for publication, it goes into review mode for either yourself or someone else to review what you plan to put in a public place. After which, you then publish externally. So yes, there is lag in that routine for the purposes of insuring proper content. If you think you have proper content then there is no lag, you just submit and then publish externally.</p>
