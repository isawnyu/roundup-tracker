<p>Parallels appears to start up ok, but when I click on the "Microsoft Windows click to start" I get an error "Unable to load the Parallels driver. Restart your Mac and try again." Restarting does not make any difference, and there seems to be no update to the software version I have. Do I need an upgrade?</p>
