My computer arrow icon has repeatedly been on its own accord as I try to move it in another direction. It usually drags itself in a down-diagonal direction, at varying distances across the monitor... This happens repeatedly throughout the day, and I can't tell if its a problem with the mouse or the computer. Please help!
