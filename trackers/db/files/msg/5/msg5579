<p>Today (8/25) I spoke with Gary Chapman. He is:</p>
<p><span class="title">Senior IT Architect &amp; Program Director, Identity Services</span><br /><span class="org">eServices, Information Technology Services</span>&nbsp;<br /><span class="tel"><span class="type">Tel</span>&nbsp;+1 212 998 3045</span><br /><span class="tel"><span class="type">Fax</span>&nbsp;+1 212 995 4120</span><br /><span class="email"><a href="mailto:gary.chapman@nyu.edu">gary.chapman@nyu.edu</a></span></p>
<p><span class="email">NYU apparently has a rigorous policy of NOT permitting LDAP access from off-campus; however, they do support single-sign-on via both Shibboleth and SAML. We would need to deploy/integrate support for one or the other on the service provider side and coordinate (both in advance and during the process) with the ID Management team (which runs these protocols on the identity provider side) on technical implementation details.</span></p>
<p><span class="email">Gary said that once you (Christopher) have had a chance to think about which of these two approaches would be better from a technical standpoint for you, you should send an email to idm.services@nyu.edu indicating which protocol you'd like to use to implement netid-based SSO and on what hosts (IPs). The conversation would then develop from there.</span></p>
