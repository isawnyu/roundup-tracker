These rooms are extremely warm in the summer. We currently have them closed to reduce the AC needed on the 6th floor. The temp is currently 105+ in the shade in the small conference room. 
Could we consider shades or some way to reduce the heat in those rooms before inserting a television or other equipment - that heat will just kill it.
