<p>Dear colleagues:</p>
<p>We need a clarification on your needs regarding the Harris Matrix Composer software before we can order the license. Specifically, which of the following licenses is the one ISAW needs:</p>
<p>1. Single-user license for 390 euro: this would only allow us to install the software on the PC we're buying for this workstation and on one and only one laptop.</p>
<p>2. Multiple single-user licenses for 390 euro each: this would allow us to install on as many PCs as we bought licenses for. In the case of individuals who had it installed on their desktop PC, they would also be licensed to put it on one laptop for field use.</p>
<p>3. The unlimited site license, for 4000 euro: this would allow us to put it on as many machines belonging to ISAW as we want</p>
<p>How shall we proceed?</p>
<p>Tom</p>
