Thanks for the quick reply. We'll get it on order. Let me know if you think of anything else.

Best,
Tom

&gt; Hi Tom,
&gt;
&gt; The standard package sounds good to me (I have a newish MacBook Pro as
&gt; my laptop). I have photoshop and will need SPSS at some point but for
&gt; now I think the standard package is all I'm going to need at first.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;

&gt;     Dear Professor Campbell:
&gt;
&gt;     Welcome (almost!) to ISAW. I'm Tom Elliott, ISAW's Associate
&gt;     Director for Digital Programs, and I'm writing to find out what you
&gt;     need in the way of computer hardware and software on your arrival at
&gt;     ISAW. Our standard package is a 21.5&quot; Macintosh iMac with a 1TB hard
&gt;     drive and 4GB of RAM. At university licensed prices, this comes out
&gt;     at $1,518. We also cover the cost of Microsoft Office.
&gt;
&gt;     Of course, we can order any type of computing system (or multiples)
&gt;     you prefer (Mac or PC), within the constraints of university
&gt;     purchasing requirements. Costs above $1,518 would need to come out
&gt;     of your research funds.
&gt;
&gt;     In order to have everything in place by the time you arrive, I'd
&gt;     like to get started on selection as soon as we can.
&gt;
&gt;     Do you have any specific preferences? Would you prefer Mac or PC? Is
&gt;     there additional specific software you will need?
&gt;
&gt;     Once we know what your basic requirements are, we'll work up a
&gt;     detailed list before ordering anything.
&gt;
&gt;     Thanks,
&gt;     Tom
&gt;
&gt;     P.S., I've copied our systems administrator, Christopher Warner, on
&gt;     this email for informational purposes.
