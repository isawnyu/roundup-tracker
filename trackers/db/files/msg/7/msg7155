<p>We may need to send Lorenzo's machine out for repair as the micrphone port has a headphone input stuck inside of it. Technically it should be possible to break the machine apart but that may void any warranty that it's under. I'll have to pull up the specifics here in the meantime there is a microphone input on the back of the machine that can be used.&nbsp;</p>
