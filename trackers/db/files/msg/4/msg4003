The upper hinge on one of the cabinet doors in the 3rd floor reception area has come completely loose from the actual cabinet unit, so that when it is opened it nearly falls on your head.  Vishal and I managed to get it closed and it remains stable as long as you don't open either cabinet door.  Unfortunately this is the cabinet that has most of our office supplies in it, so we need to get it fixed as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Whitney
