Soeren:

ISAW IT doesn't have access to your email account. Only NYU Information Technology Services can help you with lost email matters. Most expedient would be for you to contact them directly via one of the following methods:

https://www.nyu.edu/its/askits/contactus/

1-212-998-3333

AskITS@nyu.edu

They are staffed 8:00am-midnight, Mon-Fri and Noon-midnight, Sat-Sun.

You can also go in person if you prefer:

10 Astor Place, 4th Floor
9:00am-6:00pm, Mon-Fri

Best,
Tom
