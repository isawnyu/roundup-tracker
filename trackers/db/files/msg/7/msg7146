<p>We need some form of portable tray/box/etc for the adapters. What's occurring is that even though they have been repeatedly attached. At some point someone needs an adapter and snips the cable promising to return the adapter. This either never happens or does, but then the rest of the adapters start to float away.</p>
<p>The remedy proposed is to purchase a double tray set with a handful of adapters in it. I will then mar those adapters in some unique fashion such that if they float away where ever they end up they will be very noticeable. As ISAW is not a zoo it is in my deepest hopes that this will solve the problem without barbaric solutions.</p>
