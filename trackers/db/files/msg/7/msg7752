<p>Apple has changed the operation of the character viewer so it is no longer straightforward to insert non-ASCII characters into documents using it. I am researching a good how-to on using the extended US/international keyboard as an alternative and will forward a link to Beate as soon as I find (or create) something suitable. Tom</p>
