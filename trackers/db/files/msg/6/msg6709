<p>The ISAW laptop that I use for lectures, skyping, seminars, etc. wouldn't connect to the internet this morning when I tried to use it for a meeting Roger was having. It did the same thing for the holiday party, but I just thought it was a bad signal spot or something. It wouldn't even ask me for my password for the nyu network and also wouldn't connect to the nyuguest network. I've set it on Chris' desk.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
