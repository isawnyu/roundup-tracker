Thanks for your assistance.  I would actually love to get wireless access configured on my blackberry if possible.  This would help solve the poor signal problem for me.  Is this possible using the settings provided?

The documentation was very helpful, and I set my laptop up without any issues.  

Do I need to pick up an ethernet cable for LAN access?  I know I need to register my MAC id as well somehow.  Thanks!
