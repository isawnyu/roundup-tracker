<p>Lorenzo:</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear that the machine is still acting in a peculiar way. It's possible that something went wrong when the machine went to standby. Please try this:</p>
<p>Shutdown the machine (all the way to power off). Once it is completely off, turn it back on and see if it comes all the way back up and allows you to login.</p>
<p>If this works -- or if it fails -- please let us know. That will tell us whether we have had one last transient problem, or if there is a deeper difficulty that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>FYI: I'm taking ownership of this ticket for the moment, since Christopher is out of the office.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p>
