<p>This one may be user error. I wanted to share&nbsp;<a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/Members/sebastian.heath-40nyu.edu/isaw-papers-editorial-guidelines-for-authors">http://isaw.nyu.edu/Members/sebastian.heath-40nyu.edu/isaw-papers-editorial-guidelines-for-authors</a>&nbsp;so that Roger (or rather, any logged in user) could edit it as well. But I've managed to make it so that even I don't have an "edit" option.&nbsp;</p>
