Mike/Dwayne:

As we will be having a dinner in the first floor main gallery room on Monday evening, if Dwayne could sweep the floor and get rid of the leftover painters tape on the walls and floor Monday morning, that would be great. Also, please make sure the doorway from the gallery to the kitchen, and also the doors to the patio, are unlocked.

Thanks! Kate
