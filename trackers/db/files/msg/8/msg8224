<p>Right, these are issues that need to be brought to our attention before they are logged as emergencies in the ticket system. It does a disservice to us to not be able to schedule an appropriate response confining us only with-in the window that has been provided here. It also doesn't allow for us to prepare for any issues that maybe causing the issue in specific. Such as asking for wifi reconfiguration, swapping hardware or conversing, planning and performing updates at an appropriate time. I think everyone understands that there will be crisis or pinch points where we have no choice but to scramble but this seems rather discourteous. We'd ask that in the future we are offered this simply courtesy, as we do our best to try and respect each other schedules and would like to provide Exhibitions its needs the quality they deserve. We simply can't do this with last minute request, it's hard enough when we know in advance.</p>
<p>I personally will not be available tomorrow so I will not be able to see this through. Anshul if you would be so kind as to take a look here. The wireless interference is likely because of the changes RESNET made a week or more ago, the bluetooth set-up assistant is likely reloading because the machines are powered down and have to fight between the two paired mice. The software updates aren't from the app store and need to be manually installed so that must be something else, if it's just system software updates then they simply need to be completed.</p>
<p>Bumping to high in the meantime.</p>
