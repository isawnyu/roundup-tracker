<p>ASAP, I need the drawer in my area that is blocking my phone jack to be removed (it appears this will require a screwdriver). We were trying to avoid this, but unfortunately it appears my phone was never plugged into the correct port on my phone jack, so the only way to fix it is to physically switch the cable.&nbsp; My new phone will not work until this is done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am clearing out the drawer in question and will put a post-it on it so it can be identified even if I am not at my desk.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Whitney</p>
