<div class="gmail_extra">The IPhoto is working fine.</div>
<div class="gmail_extra">For the mail issue, I spoke to ITS and they said they will forward this to their Google Apps division and will contact Diane if needed.</div>

<div class="gmail_extra">Diane said we can close the ticket for the IPhoto and mail issue.</div>
