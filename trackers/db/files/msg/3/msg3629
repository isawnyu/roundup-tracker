There isn't enough space to backup Soeren's data on his laptop to the Time Machine server. I will take a closer look at this data settings but unfortunately we have 750G of space there.

With a total of only 79 available gigs. Putting our backup server at 90% capacity.

Recommendation is to purchase a proper backup device where extra hard drives can be added to a raid. Starting at 4TB.
