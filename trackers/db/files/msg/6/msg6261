<p>I'm in the process of renaming the calendars that ITS turned over to me to match Whitney's list (below). I'm also regularizing sharing of these as follows (we can expand once we're through the testing phase):</p>
<p>Christopher: manage sharing and make changes</p>
<p>Whitney: manage sharing and make changes</p>
<p>Diane: manage sharing and make changes</p>
<p>Kate: make changes to events</p>
<p>Me: manage sharing and make changes</p>

<p>I don't even know what those room numbers refer to. All of our iCal calendars are by name, as follows:</p>
<p>ISAW Events (this is a separate calendar for things that affect the entire building)<br />Oak Library<br />Lecture Hall<br />Seminar Room<br />Gallery 1<br />Gallery 2<br />Large Conf. Room<br />Small Conf. Room<br />Holidays (separate calendar for holidays that aren't necessarily NYU holidays but allow us to note days we might want to avoid scheduling on -- Jewish holidays, marathon weekend, UN General Assembly, etc.)</p>
