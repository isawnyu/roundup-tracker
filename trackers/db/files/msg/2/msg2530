With apologies, I am beginning the learning curve all over again; I had requested help on 9/16 but then I was out of the country for the past week and have forgotten EVERYTHING. I had got as far as step 4, choosing Lanier LD 345 and got to the download page for the driver. I had requested help in choosing the correct one and did get a response: PCL 6. HOWEVER, I have forgotten how to get to that stage! Can you please give me "cookbook"-type instructions from beginning to end so that I'll have it in print? I'm in and out of ISAW for the next week or so but if I have the "recipe," I can do it myself (I hope!) when I'm here. Many thanks!
