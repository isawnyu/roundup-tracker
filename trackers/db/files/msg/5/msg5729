<p>Diane: <br /> <br />The number 1 priority is on-boarding our newcomers and getting them up and running. Jennifer's hard drive crashed, so we're dealing with that (worst possible time). You're aware of other tickets you have open (e.g., phone stuff, projector bulb). Various other crises. Roger's top priority for the website (articulated at cabinet this week) is migrating the old VRS profiles onto the new site. But right now all the web stuff is deferred for the on-boarding and on-fire stuff. Obviously, the impact to your team's workflow on the event form marks it as critical. We'll get to it as soon as we can (even ahead of Roger's priorities for the site; I'm sure he'd agree that operational efficiency is more important than historical completeness). <br /> <br />Tom&nbsp;</p>
