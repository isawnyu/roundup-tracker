This is probably a task for Michael, since he's got experience doing this for the events calendars.

Roger and the cabinet would like two new calendars on ical, to be managed jointly. They are:

* ISAW deadlines (access for cabinet plus some others) - to keep track of major deadlines for the institute
* Expatriates (access for a varied group of people) - to keep track of when remote-working ISAW folks (including research associates) are likely to be in town

We should discuss this some before implementation.

Thanks,
Tom
