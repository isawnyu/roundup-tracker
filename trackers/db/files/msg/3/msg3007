I am suddenly unable to get or send email via my NYU account. I received the following message when I tested my account setting:
- Your email server rejected your login with SPA. Verify your account properties. 
-None of the authentication methods supported by this client are supported by your server.
Has something changed? I can get my email when I go on the NYU site, but I had been receiving mail addressed to my NYU account on Outlook.
Thanks,
Judith
