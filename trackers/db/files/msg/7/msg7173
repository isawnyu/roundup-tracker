<p>Had a great conversation with Darin about this over at the Law School as they've started their trial sometime ago over the internet2 backbone. Sent prelim invites to Tom/Roger/Sebastian to get some high level feedback. We'll see what commentary if any is provided. Should be noted that while talking the numbers about this Darin told me that box.com was looking at 29k for 20k users which would essentially be an NYU policy decision that needs to be made. In any event that's a different disucssion the real issue is to evaluate the functionality and to see what feedback is.</p>
