So far as I know nothing happened about it. ISAW is listed as one of NYU's Schools (like Courant and IFA) but not in the list of Centers and Institutes. This is technically correct, I guess, but confusing for outsiders (and probably many insiders) who would naturally look for something officially called an "institute" in the list of institutes.
