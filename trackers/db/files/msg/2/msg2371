To NYU Lists Administrators:

Unfortunately, due to server problems, the NYU Lists (Lyris) server has been
experiencing extreme mail delays. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience,
and we want you to know that we are working with the vendor to remedy this issue
as soon as possible.

Please note that mail messages sent to your lists over the last few days have
been archived and are available to read within the NYU Lists Message Reading
Interface (MRI).

The NYU Lists MRI may be accessed by doing the following:

1) Log into NYUHome.
2) Find the 'Lists' channel.
3) Click on the link to &quot;Read Messages&quot; for the selected list.
4) You will need to then log in with the associated list password (if one was
assigned).

Or, you may visit:

 http://lists.nyu.edu/read

Log in with the email address to which you're subscribed to your lists and the
associated password. Any list to which you are subscribed with that email and
password will appear in the interface. Select the list and its messages will
display.

We also ask that you send and reply to messages through this interface and
distribute the NYU List MRI login instructions (as above) to your list members.
We have posted this information within NYUHome for reference.

To help us optimize performance while we restore the service to normal, we ask
that you limit sending mail to your lists. We do expect the server will deliver
all queued email.

Thanks for your cooperation.
