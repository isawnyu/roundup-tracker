Help!!
The laptop I went to Kazakhstan with all of a sudden is refusing to start up. I have all the work done during the field trip there, as well as other work files that need to be processed by tomorrow at 11.00 am.
If it is not possible to turn it on, is there at least a way to save what is on the disk?
Thank you
Roberta
