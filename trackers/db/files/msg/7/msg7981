<p>Bumping to normal.. the updates must complete. If they do not complete, it causes inconsistencies in the filesystem, hence on startup it needs to check the filesystem. The filesystem itself keeps rebuilding itself because it keeps being interrupted, the startup volume had to be rebuilt entirely which took hours upon hours because of this. Checking a filesystem takes a while to do, I've turned off deep sleep on this machine and all you should have to do is let it run the relevant updates. Please, just leave the machine on and don't turn it off. Thanks.</p>
