<p>If you could sound them out I'd be grateful. I'd need a cost estimate. I certainly don't want to spend thousands on this, but if it can be done at the low end of the range you suggested, I think it would be worth it. Meanwhile I've replaced the disk, but want to have some way of ensuring it gets backed up regularly. Could this be done using TimeMachine on my desktop machine? (It might need a further backup disk depending on how much space I currently have.)</p>
