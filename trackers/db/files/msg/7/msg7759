<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>I attach here 2 images (front and side view of the same sculpture) we are considering using for the "main" promotional image, just to give you an idea.</p>
<p>However, we have yet to receive the official hi-resolution images of the objects. You'll see that these are quite grainy.</p>
<p>I hope to get the official images by the end of next week. When I do, and once we have selected the main images, I will send them your way.</p>
<p>How does that sound?</p>
<p>My best,</p>
<p>Alexander</p>
