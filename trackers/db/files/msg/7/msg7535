<p>This is the last information I have on billing associated with this matter (though I vaguely recollect a subsequent voice conversation with Diane in which we confirmed that there was no cost-per-line). But in absence of email, and given the timelag (wholly my fault), I want to double-check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diane: am I right in remembering that Vito confirmed there would be no line costs associated with doing this? Thanks, Tom</p>

<p>Vito, <br />I was wondering if you were able to confirm our costs on this? We have a meeting tomorrow where we were hoping to get on to implementation of this.<br />Thanks,<br />Diane</p>

<p>&gt; Thanks Linda. To confirm, this is exactly the scenario in which we are interested: CUPC-only lines with no corresponding physical phone for remote workers.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; T<br />&gt; <br />&gt; On 2/27/12 9:17 AM, Linda F Greenshields wrote:<br />&gt;&gt; Hi Vito,<br />&gt;&gt; I am not sure what billing structure is being put into place for CUPC<br />&gt;&gt; (Cisco Unified Personal Communicator).<br />&gt;&gt; <br />&gt;&gt; CUPC can be associated with a physical phone but it doesn't HAVE to be.<br />&gt;&gt; Up at ISAW, I think many of the CUPC users would not have a physical<br />&gt;&gt; phone in the building since they always work from off site.
