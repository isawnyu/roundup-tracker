<p>Dear Tom,</p>
<div>Some days ago I sent you an email asking your kindly to help me with finding out what suddenly is going on with a very important server (agade) from which I get all information related to ANE studies and Classics. Suddenly they put me on 'hold'. They told me to send them a message with 'unhold' but that did not solve the problem. They also recommended to contact my IT people which I did with first Chris and then you, but nobody got back to me.</div>
<div>I would also be grateful for a number whom to contact when again the Blackberry does not receive emails anymore. I had this problem with the change to google and finally it did work for two months and now suddenly again I do not receive any messages anymore.</div>
<div>I would really appreciate it to hear from you as the semester is coming close. I am still in Europe and will only return Sunday in a week but wanted the problems solved until then.</div>
<div>Best,</div>
<div>Beate</div>
