Two weeks ago we tested skype in Roger's office with a loaner laptop for the cabinet meeting. It was *much* better for me (no dropouts ... a frequent problem with the phone), but Roger had difficulty hearing what I said, even when Chuck increased the volume to what he thought was maximum. I would like to schedule and run some tests in Roger's office (with Roger and a member of the on-site IT team) so we can determine whether or not we need to add external powered speakers to the mix. Let's discuss this at our next meeting.
