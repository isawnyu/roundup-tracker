<p>I have entered 4 events into the events page. When you hold your mouse over 'Events' on the left side navigation, the four events all show up in order of earliest&nbsp; to latest date. When you go to the actual events page, however, the earliest event does not show up and the remaining 3 events are in order of latest-earliest (reverse of what it should be). Is this something I can fix on my end, or is this a more complex issue?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br /><br />Kate</p>
