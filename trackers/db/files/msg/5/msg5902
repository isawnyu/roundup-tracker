<p>This is why ISAW pays me large sums of money and Roger is break-dancing at my birthday party this year. The ticket system will not make the determination, the creator of the ticket will determine if it's resolved or not. So one opens a building ticket, you receive an automatic response that it has been received by Mike as soon as it's finished emailing him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that point, the system sits in the queue and anyone can update it, including Mike if need be. If not, the ticket will automatically be set with a status of resolved after a to be determined amount of time. In this case it will send a notice to the creator of the ticket stating that their request has been resolved. If not the creator of the ticket will be able to keep the ticket open as an exception. In which case it stays in the queue.</p>
<p>This approach cleans up the queue of completed building tickets without having to rely on Mike K. to specifically resolve each ticket himself. At the same time it provides feedback so faculty and staff don't believe their tickets to be in a black hole as well clearing the ticket bulletin-board like status of items so all of isaw specifically yourself, Roger etc are able to keep a proper pulse as to what is actually happening, what isn't happening and what needs to happen.</p>
