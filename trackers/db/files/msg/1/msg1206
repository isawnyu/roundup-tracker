ISAW will host the Sarcophagus Conference on October 2 and 3.  There will be lectures taking place in the Lecture Room on both days, which should be set up with the silver chairs in lecture format for as many people as can comfortably fit.

There will be a reception in the Oak Library on October 2nd at 6:00pm, and we would like Dwayne to stay if possible from 6-9pm for cleanup, etc.

Thank you!
