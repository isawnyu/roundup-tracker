<p>This is fixed, the Event Abstract field has been repopulated as a RichText field and should be populated instead of the description. Both can be used but formatting will only show with using the Abstract field. This is a complicated discussion that deals with DublinCore. Technically speaking I guess on save I could populate the description field with the exact same thing that is located in the Abstract field and hide the description field but lets see how it works in practice. It's possible that the description and abstract for an event are different. I'll wait to see what Kate has to say. Testing.</p>
