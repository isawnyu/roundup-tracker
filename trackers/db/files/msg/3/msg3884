Karen you can reformat the key that I gave you on Windows and then copy the files onto the key from the Mac. The problem is that you are trying to read the key on Windows and Windows doesn't support the Mac format for which that key was probably setup.

So simply confirm the format (you will indeed lose everything on the key, but this is why we kept a copy on the scanner machine).

Then when you come in add the key to the Mac, it should be able to read it and then copy everything over. If i'm not here Ben will be and he will be able to help. I'll let him know of the issue in specific so he is aware.
