I have mentioned this to Dwayne, and I believe he is working on it, but just to have a record, on Thursday afternoon we will be having tea service in the lecture hall as the Oak Library will be in the midst of setup for the Exhibition Opening.  We will need a table set up in the lecture hall for this purpose. Thanks.
