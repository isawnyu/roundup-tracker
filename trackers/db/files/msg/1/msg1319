Hi Mike:

There are a set of extensions that we are being charged for, although there are no phones in the jacks. My guess is that Tim returned the phones, but did not request that the jacks be deactivated. They include the following

x27818 (Jessica's previous number)
x27835
x27820
x27823 
x27829
x27824
x27842
x27854
x27852
x27848
x27849

The scholars and students will not be given phones in their carrels next year, so I will not ask you to reactivate these lines.

Please let me know if I need to sign the appropriate service request form.

many thanks,
Suzan
