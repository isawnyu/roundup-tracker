1) Please change the two non-working light bulbs in the 4th Floor copy room. 
2) Also, the third light bulb (over the copier) is hanging from its electrical wiring! Please inspect and fix if possible. 
3) One of the lower cabinet's handles has come off. Please repair the knob; it is currently sitting on the counter next to the fax machine.
