Dear All,
A repair to the AC system is scheduled for tomorrow that will require us to drain the system. Once it is repaired, the system will be started, but it may take a couple of hours for the building to cool and reach a tolerable humidity. The building will be open but you are encouraged to find cooler quarters to work.
Diane
