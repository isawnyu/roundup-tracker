Hi Irene:

I can request this for you from NYU ITS, or you can do it yourself by sending an email to askits@nyu.edu. The email should say who you are, what you want (&quot;a new email alias of isaw_exhibitions@nyu.edu&quot;) and provide a list of all the email addresses you want included in the alias. The rationale for doing it yourself is that later, if you want to make changes to the list of those subscribed, you can follow up with another email to askits@nyu.edu and they'll process it since you were the originator. Probably faster than going through us.

Anyway, let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Tom
