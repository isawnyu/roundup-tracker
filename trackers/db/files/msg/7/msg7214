<p>I have received a couple of calls alerting me to the fact that in Bing our number is still showing up as 212-922-7800.&nbsp; On a hunch I checked the source code of our pages and found the following code on every page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre id="line1"><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">div</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">visualClear</a>" <span class="attribute-name">id</span>="<a class="attribute-value">post-sections-clear</a>"&gt;</span><span class="comment">&lt;!-- --&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">div</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">div</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">div</span> <span class="attribute-name">class</span>="<a class="attribute-value">contact</a>"&gt;</span><span> 15 East 84th St. New York, NY 10028 212-922-7800 isaw@nyu.edu </span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">div</span>&gt;</span><br /><br />This appears to be what Bing (and Yahoo, which I've also checked) is reading and reporting as our number, even though it appears to be listed correctly on our website.  It's not affecting Google because our directory listing with them has the correct number.  </pre>
