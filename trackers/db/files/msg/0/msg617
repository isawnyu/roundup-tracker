hello Jack we spoke about the library temperature and i hope this week i will have the problem solved. The diffrence in temperature on the 3rd and 5th fl  can not be changed because hot air travels faster than cold air. This morning i lowerd the temp because it was to hot, but let me know if there is any problems.
