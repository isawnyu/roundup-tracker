<p>To Whom this may concern,</p>
<p>Currently at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World we have many loaner laptops, internet enabled devices etc that we loan to faculty, staff, visiting research scholars and others. This isn't a big issue for parties that have their own netid however more often than not the visitor or user does not have a netid. We also have several systems that need to utilize my netid in specific to get things like the wireless password for the week and other items.</p>
<p>Is there some way to get a general purpose netid for the Institute as a whole which we would be able to use on these devices and systems without having to utilize my netid? I'm assuming at the very least that having to repeatedly give out my netid is a security issue but also it's tiresome to have to enter this repeatedly ad nauseum.</p>
<p>If there the Institute itself can't have a netid, are there any recommendations on how better to manage a situation like this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
