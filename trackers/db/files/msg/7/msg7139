<p>I have been having repeated crashes of Acrobat Pro on my home machine; it either crashes immediately on opening a document or at attempts to save them. I am inclined first to install updates, which I haven't done recently because I can't remember what the administrator password is. (I'm sure Christopher told me at some point, but I can't find this anywhere.) If not, I think that the original media for the software, if we have any, are at ISAW, where it was installed, and it might be necessary to start over. Any experience of this problem or advice?</p>
