Hi Tom,

Nice to meet you. Apologies for the delayed response -- we ran into a small bump with the installation of the University CMS that has kept us occupied. 

We're currently in the process of gathering the necessary files from around the university for inclusion on the NYU iTunes U site and YouTube EDU channel. As Lynne's memo suggested, our goal is to provide a central point for users to access the breadth of activities and academic enterprise at NYU. 

At the moment, we are primarily looking for academic video and audio files, with priority being given to lectures, seminars, and other course material. We'll also be looking to include any media highlighting student life, programs and activities, and/or special events. However, we are not including straight marketing materials at this time. That said, if you have media that is used for marketing purposes which you feel still contains an academic message, we are happy to consider them.

Long term, our hope is to provide schools and administrative units access to a digital asset management system (currently being installed in conjunction with the CMS), which will support not only archiving of your private videos, but the necessary transcoding and web services connections to social media site that will allow each school the flexibility to publish video and audio files at will. In the meantime, we'll be manually collecting, processing, and posting the files.

I've cc'd my colleague Christopher James, who will coordinate the collection of appropriate videos and the necessary encoding/transcoding so that we can post optimal quality videos in each environment. He'll follow up shortly with specific formats we're looking for, but in short, we'll be asking for the highest quality raw media you have available. 

In addition to the media file, we'll be looking for the following information:

1) Podcast or Playlist*

&#65533; Name
&#65533; Description
&#65533; Related  Links
&#65533; Topic
&#65533; Artwork**

1.x) Podcast Episode or Playlist Video

&#65533; Name
&#65533; Description
&#65533; Speaker
&#65533; Topic
&#65533; Artwork**


2) Standalone Video or Audio File

&#65533; Name
&#65533; Description
&#65533; Speaker
&#65533; Topic
&#65533; Artwork**

* The term &quot;podcast&quot; refers to the overall set of media files, or episodes. A podcasts can be subscribed to via multiple formats/clients and implies a regular additional of episodes. (In YouTube, podcasts take the form of playlists, and can currently be subscribed to only through another YouTube account.) We will look to group files into podcasts and playlists whenever possible. However, our preference will be to allow the content creators to organize the media how they best see fit. If you have podcasts or playlists

** Please provide a default file graphic for iTunes U (175x175). In the event that no artwork is included with the podcast/episode, we will use the generic artwork in its place. If no artwork is provided, we will use default NYU graphics.


Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about the process.

Best,
Joel
