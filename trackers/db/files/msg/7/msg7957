<p>A quick note about some changes to our Autodesk distribution process:</p>
<p>*Distribution*<br />*<br />*<br />Going forward, all Autodesk Education Master Suite <br />&lt;http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=13163166&gt; licenses <br />will be distributed electronically via the NYU Computer Store <br />&lt;http://www.bookstores.nyu.edu/computer.store/&gt;. In order to renew your <br />license or purchase new ones, you will need to visit or call the NYU <br />Computer Store &lt;http://www.bookstores.nyu.edu/computer.store/&gt;. The <br />Software @ NYU team will no longer handle this process.</p>
<p>*Annual License Timeframe &amp; Cost*</p>
<p>We have some excellent news for our administrative units -- the cost of <br />Autodesk Education Master Suite is now $155 / seat. This is an even <br />better rate than the $250 / seat we recovered previously! Woohoo!</p>
<p>All annual licenses are valid from _September 1st, through August 31st_. <br />With your renewals upon you, please contact the NYU Computer Store <br />&lt;http://www.bookstores.nyu.edu/computer.store/&gt; soon to renew the <br />licenses you have and purchase any additional licenses you need.</p>
<p>*Standalone / Networked Licenses*</p>
<p>Without getting too technical, we provide access to two types of licenses:</p>
<p>* *Standalone* licenses are your typical license. You purchase<br /> one, install it on a computer, and anyone at that machine can<br /> use that license.<br /> * *Networked* license, which permits you to install the software<br /> on as many machines as you'd like, but limits the number of<br /> simultaneous users. How does it do that, you ask. Well, we set<br /> up something of a library with however many licenses you<br /> purchased, and each time the software is launched, it checks<br /> with the library to make sure one of the licenses is available<br /> for use.</p>
<p>ITS can help you with networked licenses and even provide you with the <br />library (aka license manager). If you are interested in this, you can <br />contact us at nyu.software@nyu.edu &lt;mailto:nyu.software@nyu.edu&gt;</p>
<p>-------- -------- --------</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions about the new methods we're <br />putting place. We hope you find this a more natural and obvious way to <br />acquire Autodesk or the other software we license. As always, if you are <br />interested in partnering on other software packages, please don't <br />hesitate to reach out to us. We're always looking for new opportunities <br />to save NYU money!</p>
