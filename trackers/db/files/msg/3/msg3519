This afternoon Garfield reported that the basement door was unlocked. After extensive discussion with the NYU security office throughout the evening, they dispatched an officer to ISAW, who found that the door's bolt was just stuck inside the door. 

Compounding the pressure was that the camera covering the egress is out. I will follow up with NYU DPS tomorrow, as I had asked for them to make sure all cameras were working by 2/25 for the new exhibit.

We need a flashlight at the front desk in case of emergency. The bolt needs a dose of WD-40.
