I just noticed that there have been no steps taken to replicate the information about exhibitions-related events found on the Nubia site ( http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/exhibitions/nubia/programs.html ) on the events page of the main website ( http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/events.htm ). I assume we want to fix that and so shall momentarily be opening a ticket on the helpdesk for it and starting to make it happen.
