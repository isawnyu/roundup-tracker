<p>This device has been setup at cloud.isaw.nyu.edu and so far it simply doesn't work as advertised. There are a couple of problems with it.</p>
<p>1. The main processor is extremely slow, as in it takes almost 5 minutes to boot.<br />2. It doesn't seem to be able to stay on the network if communications with pogoplug.com are delayed or it's not able to talk to the machine. This has happened almost 4 times in the last hour.<br />3. You can only connect a USB printer to this device.<br />4. As the processor is slow, it doesn't seem to be able to keep up with large data transfer so over the local network I get about 1MBps. I haven't tried direct connection with USB but it's likely that would be quicker, of course, negating the whole cloud aspect of the device.<br />5. You can only upload one (1) file at a time, if you'd like to upload in a fashion that sends multiple files at once, you'll need to open multiple browser sessions. This slows down the device.<br />6. &nbsp;The web application seems to work very poorly.<br />7. You can't perform more than one task. So for instance, if you are deleting a file, it doesn't queue for deletion and let you continue on with your life. It sits there until the process is actually complete. This would be ok if it deleted files rather quickly but it does not. Infact it looks as if it will wait until every other process is complete before it deletes. That is just simply unacceptable.</p>
<p>I will continue to play with the device through-out the week but I'm not impressed. Of course, i'm being rather critical because these problems will snowball into bigger issues when a host of people are using the drive. It would seem even as a singular device it wouldn't pass muster as being anything but sub standard. Not that the device doesn't have it's saving graces such as transcoding of uploaded video on the file but, even then that would take forever because the processor is slow.</p>
