<p>We ordered 6 license seats of Mac Office 2011 (at $58 apiece) on 1 April 2011 (PO # EW400889), plus one copy of the Office 2011 Mac media DVD (for $27). These licenses were intended for the 4 new/replacement Macs we budgeted to buy in FY2011 (Tiffany, 1 other administration machine replacement, 1 faculty replacement, 1 scanner/workstudy replacement), plus 2 spares. To my knowledge, only two of these computers (Tiffany's and Roger's secondary) were actually purchased. We did buy another 1 seat license of Mac Office 2011 for Roger's Macbook Air in June 2011 (PO#&nbsp;EW412974).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, apart from licenses purchased on grant money for my laptop and Tim Hill's laptop, we should already have 7 Mac Office 2011 licenses in our possession. I do not know how many of these were actually installed, but I assume that at least 1 of them ended up on Tiffany's machine, a second on Roger's secondary machine, and another on Roger's MBA as planned. We also do own a set of media, so shouldn't have to purchase that again.</p>
<p>Under "Department Software Licensing" on the NYU Computer Store's iBuy page, I see that the Office 2011 Mac license (Product ID Number: 1733731) is still listed at $58 per seat. This is what we were buying last year and, unless there's some compelling reason to do otherwise, think we should continue to use. Note that media now is distributed on USB key, at $10 apiece, but as I said above, we shouldn't need this.</p>
<p>But we shouldn't be buying more Office 2011 licenses if the count of our install base doesn't match the number of licenses we bought last year. There are 4 licenses we definitely purchased for which I know of no corresponding install (but I'm not in the loop on that, so that's not surprising). If we don't have a record of installs somewhere else, we probably need to have someone spot-check ISAW-owned machines and make a list.</p>
