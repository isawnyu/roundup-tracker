We do not have any estimate for the number of attendees. I will ask Jessica what room they think we should be in; last I heard they had only assigned us tentatively. As to video: I was not aware that ISAW did not have a camera. There is not presently any budget allotted for that sort of thing, and given the short time frame I think we should forget having video. Does ISAW have native capability for audio capture, or would this also require resort to campus media?
