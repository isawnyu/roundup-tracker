Hi Mike,

I have discovered two building issues in the library.  On the 5th floor, the handle is loose on one of the doors leading into the reading room area.  And, on the top floor of the stacks, the compact shelving unit on the far right side sticks when it is moved to the right.  I checked the tracks for screws, but did not see anything that might be causing the obstruction.  There is, however, something on the bottom of the unit that is scraping the floor.

Thanks,
Dawn
