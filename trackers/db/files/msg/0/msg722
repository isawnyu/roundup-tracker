Tim:

Before staff meeting next week, could you kindly see if you could create a "Join Our Mailing List" page.
NYUAD has one and perhaps you could copy the code:
http://nyuad.nyu.edu/news.events/join.mailing.list.html

If you choose to copy the code, you'll need to remove the check boxes for "Sheikh Mohamed Scholars" and "Consultancy Firms"
