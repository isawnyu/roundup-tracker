Beate, 

There is but so much that I can do here because I simply don't control email. The migration efforts complete and everything is working according to downtown.

Please follow these directions: http://www.nyu.edu/life/resources-and-services/nyu-google-migration/your-first-days/mobile-users/blackberry.html

and let me know if you are having a problem still. If I could simply fix this by looking at your computer I would but it involves your password information.
