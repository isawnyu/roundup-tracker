This is still a critical issue, the approach is to document each and every single problem with the book scanner as it happens. After which I will escalate the problem with ImageAccess and either have them send a new book scanner or make sure the one that we have does what it was bought for.

If they can do neither I will forward the documentation to the appropriate parties.
