Actually Jennifer's machine needs more ram. At this point it only has 1GB and with just her email client and safari open she's down to 60MB free. Not withstanding, Jennifer's usage is heavy in regards to memory related activity. PDF documents and such etc. 1GB is simply unacceptable for this workload.

The machine is an Imac 7,1
Mid 2007 20 inch model.

Pushing 4 years it needs a memory upgrade:
