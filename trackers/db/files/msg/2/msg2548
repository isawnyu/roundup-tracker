Chuck:

This is only a problem for people using the isaw.nyu.edu domain, which we weren't advertising (it's staged for the next gen website). We've repeatedly asked for this to be fixed (it's a downtown problem) but are getting only dialtone.

Everyone should be using http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/events.htm
