Request IT support for two back-to-back public lectures on the evening of 14 April 2009. Details are on the wiki at http://serv1.isaw.nyu.edu/groups/workgroup/wiki/d0016/Publishing_Archaeological_Data_on_the_Web.html .

We request:

* Projection capability. Presenters are bringing their own laptops and are very comfortable with A/V presentations. 
* Power at podium for presenters' laptops.
* Sound reinforcement if, in your judgment, it is regularly needed and useful in the room we're assigned.
* Is it possible to capture video and audio for later reprocessing and dissemination as a podcast, YouTube video or the like?

Please let me know if you need additional information.
