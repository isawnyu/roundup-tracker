<p>If the drive is plugged in please unplug it and power it down. Do not try to mount it again, I'll be around to pick it up today, if it's in recoverable state we'll do that and transfer to one of the externals that we have. If not we'll have to ship it out, which will get expensive. I've exhausted my get your data back free favor on Iris's failed drive so I can't exploit that.</p>
