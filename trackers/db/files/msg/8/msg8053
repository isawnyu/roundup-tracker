<p>Tom and Chris,</p>
<p>1. Diane as Administration assignee, just as you have Mike for Building <br />tickets.</p>
<p>2. Notification should go (at least) to Roger, John, and Whitney (as my <br />backup).</p>
<p>Who else do you think it should go to? Should we discuss at Cabinet <br />(momentarily)?</p>
