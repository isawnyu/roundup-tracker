I am using an "auto-recovery" version of a document and now trying to save it. Word looks like it has saved it as a Word document with a new name, but I can't open it - it goes into an endless loop. I also can't save it as a .pdf. 

I've been toying with this over the past few days and am both out of patience and out of time. It keeps going into an endless loop and I have to "force quit" Word. 

Got a clue what the problem is?
