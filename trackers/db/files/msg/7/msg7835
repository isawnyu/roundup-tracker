<p>Tom,</p>
<p>Hello, this is Seung from the NYU Google Apps team. Thanks for contacting us about creating a resource calendar. The following resource calendar has been created:</p>
<p>ISAW Teleconference Bridge</p>
<p>with the owners:<br />te20@nyu.edu<br />cww6@nyu.edu<br />db142@nyu.edu</p>
<p>Please note that it may take up to 24 hours before you can add the resource calendar to an event. If there are any further questions or issues, you can respond to this email.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Seung</p>
