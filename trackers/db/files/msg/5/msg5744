<p>When the stoves were moved, it created a gap in the woodwork that does not protect the stove from food and spills. Please fill this gap to retain sanitary and safe conditions.</p>
<p>The new stovetop needs to be sealed to the countertop with clear caulking, per our discussion for the same reasons.</p>
<p>Food service starts on 9/12 and Kathy would like to start cooking on 9/8.</p>
<p>Thanks, Diane &amp; Kathy</p>
