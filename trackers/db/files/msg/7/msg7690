<p>Unfortunately there is nothing that I can do about this any longer, it seems it is now NYU policy to purchase recycled toner cartridges. Recycled cartridges will always leak and destroy the internals of a printer. Diane first told me about this policy last week so you may find out from her as to next steps. In the meantime there is very little that I can do as I don't create the policy. Leaving open, but will close as wontfix.</p>
