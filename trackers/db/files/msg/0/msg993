Hi Mike--

I just spoke with Richard and he asks that the floor in the Oak Library be left as it is. Nothing (furniture) should be moved and the carpet should not be returned to its original place until Richard gives us the green light. Richard will be here tomorrow to check on everything. In the meantime, I've asked everyone to stay out of that room until further notice.

Best,
Suzan
