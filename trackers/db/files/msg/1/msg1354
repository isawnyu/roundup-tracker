The Birth of European Painting in the Sands of Egypt

This lecture is a preliminary report on a project studying some 62 painted panels from Roman Egypt, which are practically the only surviving examples of this important artistic genre from the ancient world. Representing the Egyptian pantheon in its final manifestation, they are an important document of the history of religion. But the evidence also looks forward to the continuance of panel painting in the medieval world, introducing many of the formulae and compositions of Byzantine icon painting, formulae which endured even to the Renaissance.
