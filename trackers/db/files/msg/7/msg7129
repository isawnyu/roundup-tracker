<p>The 4th floor color printer will not print images, even when reduced in size. I started with an 8mb file, then a 3, then 1.2 and it still would not print. It would print out white pages with an error message (said the image was the error) and the printer would say "insufficient memory."</p>
<p>We need to print out color proofs of our posters and didactics for shows, and have had this issue before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
