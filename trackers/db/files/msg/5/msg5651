<p>My followup:</p>
<p>Meredith: <br /> <br />This sounds great! I'm trying to get a full count now of how many seats we would need. A couple of follow-up (logistical) questions: <br /> <br />1. How would we go about requesting the number of licenses we need? Do they need to go in in bulk at a particular time of the year or can we do them piecemeal? If at a particular time, what's the deadline? <br /> <br />2. Do we need media for each license or just a single media copy for install? <br /> <br />3. Are these standalone or network licenses? <br /> <br />4. What are the terms of the license (esp. who can and can't use the licensed software)? I looked on the AUTOCAD site under "Master Suite" and various links, but couldn't find that information. We have a mix of students, faculty and visiting research scholars who may need this software. <br /> <br />Thanks, <br />Tom&nbsp;</p>
