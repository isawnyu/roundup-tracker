So we'll be using Roundup for issue tracking.. I've already begun modifying it heavily on our new automation server: http://automaton.isaw.nyu.edu:8081/help/index. Automaton will manage all of the automated processes that need to be built, and all of the help/issue/tracking systems. It currently uses Freebsd 8.0 and is a sourced Dell machine that was sitting here doing nothing since i've been here.

I am currently waiting to hear back from ITS as to why I don't have access to isawapp.nyu.edu or what happened to the ssh server there. It seems they moved isawapp.nyu.edu and I'm not sure what machine it's on now.

I've decided that ticket.isaw.nyu.edu will be the new address for the ticket system and help.isaw.nyu.edu will take you to a landing page that will shoot you off into the right direction for help whatever it may be.
