Christopher:

In order facilitate Irene Soto's work on the papyrological project, we need to have the latest version of the Zotero plugin for Firefox. That plugin is incompatible with the down versions of Firefox that are currently installed on those machines. Can we upgrade them please?

Thanks,
Tom
