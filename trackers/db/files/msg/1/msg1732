Hi Mike/Chris:

I'm having a problem with Windows 7. Each time I try to pull up a budget report and save it on my desktop, it simply won't come up. I've successfully installed the Hyperion Client, but for some reason the PDF or excel versions of the reports cannot be saved onto the desktop....would be grateful for assistance.

Best,
Suzan
