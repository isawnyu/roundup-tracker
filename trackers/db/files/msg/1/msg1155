There will be a short lecture/reception (for the University of Michigan Alumni Assoc.) here on September 17th in the Lecture Room, from 6:30-7:30pm.

The room should be set up in lecture format with 50 chairs in the front half, with tables for food in the back of the room and a little space to walk around.  We will need the 6ft gray folding table, and if there are any other tables available (there used to be two smaller ones in the seminar room), that would be great.

Would Dwayne be available to stay until between 8 and 9?  This is a small event that will hopefully require minimal cleanup, and Adriana will be staying as well.

Thanks and please let me know if you need any further information.
