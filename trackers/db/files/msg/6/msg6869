<p>Hi Christopher,<br />I totally support this change !<br />I will not have to bother Tom anymore every time I need to update the site.</p>
<p>I've given a quick look to the "moved" site and it looks OK to me.</p>
<p>Go ahead also changing the svn mode; I don't even know who did the first setup (either Tom or Tim Lippert, I guess).</p>
<p>The svn will be moved too, I imagine. Could you please send me the link to the new location and confirm whether my credentials will unchanged ?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Bruno</p>
