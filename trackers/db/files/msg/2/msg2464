Hello.

Due to the nature of Alex's work (scanning and sending files) we are running into network storage space issues because his PC is connected to the NYU Library network.  Is it possible to disconnect his PC from the library network and, instead, connect his PC to the ISAW network?  We are planning to make use of NYU Files to reduce the storage demands we are making on the library system, but thought that disconnecting from library network might be a good idea.  

Thanks,
Dawn
