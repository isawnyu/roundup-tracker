Hello,

As we continue to get the 6th floor pantry properly supplied, we would like to move the automatic covered garbage can in the basement dining room upstairs to the 6th floor pantry area, and move one of our larger plastic garbage cans into the dining room temporarily while we order a new automated can.  (There are a few of these larger cans in the 3rd floor janitor's closet but I have been unable to separate one from the stack by myself.)

Thanks,
Whitney
