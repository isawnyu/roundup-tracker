<p>The "groups" folder on the server has been inaccessible to both Kate and myself since late yesterday afternoon (we both seem to be able to connect to the server just fine, but that folder no longer appears). I don't know if it is missing or just our access to it has suddenly been restricted (and I don't know who else might be affected), but since that folder contains all of the shared documents we work with we need it back ASAP.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
