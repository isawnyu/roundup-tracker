A phone has been approved for the 2nd desk at the Reception desk, where Kate used to sit. 
This will be used by scholars and staff that do not have phones at their desk and have to resort to the central ISAW number for NYU internal use. It can also be used by anyone that is backing up Whitney at the Reception desk. It should take overflow calls from Whitney's phone and not be listed in the directory for incoming calls, but should be able to make outgoing calls. Can we restrict to local &amp; 800# only?
