<p>Kathryn got me Robert's netid which is rgh2 and I've forwarded to his oxford email the instructions on activating it. I'll check in tomorrow to confirm that it has been indeed activated so that I can push the communications request form for the new phone in his office. Once that is done this ticket will be about halfway complete.</p>
