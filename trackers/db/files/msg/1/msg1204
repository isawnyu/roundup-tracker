There will be a conference held in the Oak Library on Saturday, September 26.  Mike, I appreciate your help and apologize for the inconvenience.  This is the last external event that will be taking place at ISAW, which we have committed to and have already taken payment; Suzan has made John aware of this.

The furniture Oak Libary will need to moved out in order to make room for 100 silver chairs in lecture format.  This will be the same setup as we had for the Leon Levy Lecture.  If possible, the large wooden table should go in front of the middle window with enough room for one person to sit behind it.

Additionally, there will be a screen and projector set up in the front, along with the podium and a platform (4'x12') for a table.  We will need the large gray folding table in the front of the room, to go on top of the platform (being rented and delivered).

Finally, the smaller gray folding table will need to be available as a reception table in the foyer.  As long as it will stay in the gallery where it currently is, I can move it out to the foyer on Saturday morning.

This will need to be set up on Thursday, September 24th, so that there will be ample time for A/V setup and deliveries before the event on the 26th.  

Thank you very much and let me know if you have any questions.
