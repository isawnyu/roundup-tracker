During the past week we have emptied about 20 gallons of water from the buckets under the leak.

I am beginning to notice what looks like mold on the concrete beam at the 5th floor level.  I am increasingly concerned about the possibility of moisture in the walls and potential mold growth and damage to the collections.

The moving stacks remain problematic.  In one place the stacks simply will not move far enough to use.
