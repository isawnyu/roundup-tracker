Dear Chris,

The computer problems are:

Time machine cannot back up.
Cannot connect to the ISAW server.
Cannot see any of the iCal information.
Very slow (only 1G of RAM).

I'll be away Feb-28-March 4, but be nice to the hard drive, since most of what I've done in the last month is only there (though I do have a flash drive backup of the most important document).

You can use &quot;pddes&quot; as the code to unlock anything that needs to be unlocked on &quot;exhibition&quot;. (No secrets here...).

See you in a week,
Peter
