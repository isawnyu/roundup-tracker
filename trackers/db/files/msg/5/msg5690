<p>1. How would we go about requesting the number of licenses we need? Do they need to go in in bulk at a particular time of the year or can we do them piecemeal? If at a particular time, what's the deadline?</p>
<p>You can request licenses at any time during the year keeping in mind all licenses are annual licenses and expire in early September regardless of when you purchase them.&nbsp; In the past, we have "pro-rated" licenses that start in or after January to $100 / seat.</p>
<p>2. Do we need media for each license or just a single media copy for install?</p>
<p>You can download the files, though we're working being able to distribute media through the Computer Store.&nbsp; It's all sort of up in the air at the moment, but we'll get it to you, I promise.</p>
<p>3. Are these standalone or network licenses?</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; You let us know which you prefer, and we'll set it up accordingly.</p>
<p>4. What are the terms of the license (esp. who can and can't use the licensed software)? I looked on the AUTOCAD site under "Master Suite" and various links, but couldn't find that information. We have a mix of students, faculty and visiting research scholars who may need this software.</p>
<p>It's not so much who can use it as who owns the computer on which it is running.&nbsp; The licenses are for NYU owned machines.&nbsp; Ostensibly for use by faculty and staff, however, students working on NYU projects (not their own coursework) on NYU owned machines would qualify.<br /> <br />Autodesk provides free, student versions of Autodesk by teacher request ... or so I understand.</p>
