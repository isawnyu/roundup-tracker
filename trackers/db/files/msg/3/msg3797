This is so that persons at ISAW can see the user statistics for the AWDL server at the Library.  So we need, optimally, the full range of IPs in use at ISAW (as we would need for instance to provide institutional access to licensed library resources).  If we can't do that we need my IP, Dawn's and Sebastian's, but the full range would be preferable.

Thanks,
