After taking a look at the specifics of this drive, it has a notorious track record for dying. I'm actually surprised it has lasted as long as it has after a simple google search. The drive is most likely replaceable by itself but the product in question is long since out of warranty. Recommendation is to simply get a new unit and then migrate the existing backup setup over.
