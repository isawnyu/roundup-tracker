<p>Dear Tom,</p>
<p>This is Sehna Rostom from the IT Service Desk, writing regarding your requests to update the name of ISAw "15 E 84th st " calendar rroms to match what opwners are seeing.</p>
<p>When I look under "Rooms etc." to invite ISAW calendars, I see them listed as:</p>
<p>ISAW - 15 E 84th st-110<br />ISAW - 15 E 84th st-111<br />ISAW - 15 E 84th st-200<br />ISAW - 15 E 84th st-202<br />ISAW - 15 E 84th st-204</p>
<p>Is this not correct? Please provide more info.</p>
<p>You can reply to this email or call us at (212) 998-3333 and use the referenced ticket number above.</p>
