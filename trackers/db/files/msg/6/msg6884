<p>Technically no but considering I do have large amounts of cord in this office it doesn't seem such a far stretch. As we roughly ran over earlier I ran into Linda's communication team bringing in new cable and they assure me that they indeed do have a longer cord but it will be black. We'll try to get it slotted asap... should for some reason you just can't stand the black or whatever we'll just purchase this and try to get it in a nice form of grey blue or grey or whatever this is:</p>
