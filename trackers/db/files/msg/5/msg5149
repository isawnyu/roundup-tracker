We need a machine that simply has all of the software we own at ISAW located in a place that everyone can use it should they either be having issues with their computer or need to use licensed software where we only have one license. 

This will alleviate having to manage multiple licenses and cutting cost and at the same time making sure we cover the gamut of uses and needs of faculty/staff and vrs's

It's slightly inconvenient but wholly manageable going forward until we have time to spend on licensing, etc etc
