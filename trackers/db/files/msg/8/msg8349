<p>Swapped Roger's mouse for a new one, updated his machine. Roger's machine is just acting weird, slow and is very irksome. At some point this week I need to take stock of what is causing the slowdown, it looks like Thunderbird is using deprecated libs and it's possible Parallels has something to do with this.<br /><br />If it's thunderbird I'll send a bug report as I don't have time to patch that problem but hopefully someone does. If it's parallels driver issues we'll see.&nbsp;</p>
