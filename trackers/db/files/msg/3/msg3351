I'm sorry to be a pest about this, but the system is truly flaky, and I keep having to shut down email and restart it in order to see what's there; the calendar just doesn't update reliably when people put things on it. This is fundamentally an intolerable situation; today I was trying to schedule something without having an accurate view of existing commitments.
