<p>Thanks for this suggestion Jorge, unfortunately writing a program to install a printer queue doesn't solve the issue. While it's a great temporary stop-gap suggestion the pertinent issue at hand is making devices that are available on the wired network also available to our wireless users. As most users increasingly tend to the choice of laptops and wireless devices it's very difficult for me to understand why policy hasn't been reviewed here.</p>
<p>I understand the above wholly and fully but the scenario presented in using a computer as essentially a printer server should in no way be against NYU policy. It does in no way harm NYU-NET in any manner, especially using local broadcast and provides a useful and long lasting solution. If anything I would believe this would be the more preferred method as it limits traffic and obviously the vector for security exploits become limited.</p>
<p>Wired network resources at ISAW are slowly become less of the rule and more of the option leaving most of our wired network resources to a small group of desktops and the rest to server resources. Who do I need to speak with in order to review this policy?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
