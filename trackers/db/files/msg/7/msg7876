<p>After spending the afternoon with this, it is turning into more of an issue it seems that the company used for managing this has an "installer" user to do administrative things in the domain. Unfortunately i'm not sure where in the chain the issue is. Either with the domain settings or locally. I'll have to backup all of Mike's files and completely wipe this machine at this rate, i'm thinking either tomorrow or Thursday if I get an opportunity to do this as it will likely be a full day exercise.</p>
