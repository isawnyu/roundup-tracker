<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>Some of the screws in the floor in the library stacks area have worked loose.&nbsp; Chuck tightened the two screws that were causing the immediate problem, but it is probably time to schedule another maintenance walkthrough.&nbsp; Let me know if you have questions.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
