<p>Chris,</p>
<p>Thanks for the help yesterday. Appears it is working better, but now have the 2 password issue (argh!). However, Tom's calendar is still not resolving - getting "The server responded with an error. The request for account "te20@nyu.edu" failed." When I select 'Go Online' it does resolve, but the error message appears again when I open the gCal.</p>
<p>My MobileMe is also not resolving.</p>
<p>Thanks, Diane</p>
