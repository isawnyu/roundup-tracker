<p>Option 2 is now attached. A Dell T1600 with 16 GB of RAM. I chose this workstation because it's a tested configuration by AUTOCAD, but the other option looks hotter to me. I chose the&nbsp; <span>1.0GB NVIDIA&reg; Quadro&reg; 600, Dual MON &nbsp;card, again, because it's tested and certified by both AUTOCAD and Adobe (but note that on this workstation, we can't get true dual monitor through the same kind of interface, one monitor will have to be DVI, the other DP ... or so I read the fine print).</span></p>
<p>Note also that both options are with 2 drives configured as RAID1. This option has 500GB effective; the other option is 1TB effective.</p>
