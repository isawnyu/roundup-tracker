Ok, this ticket system is setup to be time zone neutral and it's not the best ticket system we are highly aware of the problem and will hopefully be replacing it sometime in the near future. That aside I will do my best to make sure all your information is saved. I will be out of the country for a bit but will be returning towards early April and we'll continue from where we left off.

As far as format goes TIFF should be readable by Windows but may require a specific program to do so. That would be off if it couldn't do so natively.
