Since the two 6th floor conference rooms will be available to use sometime next month, we need to go ahead and set up calendars for them in iCal so that people can reserve the space as needed. (I'm already getting requests.) The calendars can be called "Conference Room 1" and "Conference Room 2."

Thanks,
Whitney
