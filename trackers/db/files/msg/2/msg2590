The ticket for this is: INC000000282215

I spoke with Irene and due to the time constraints they had to use Roberta's current line. The next steps are to request a brand new line for Roberta for the 6th floor; which will require a little updating for ITS records but we will see.

Turn-around here is currently unknown; however we are looking Tuesday October 19, 2010 the earliest.
