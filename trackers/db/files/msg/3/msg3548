Hello,

The student work computer in the 3rd floor reception area needs to be set up for Parallels and Office within Parallels to work on a project.  Right now there is a Parallels icon in the Applications folder but when it is opened, there is a message that it can't be accessed because the files have been moved.  We have a very big and time-sensitive project we'd like to get the students started on that requires using Parallels so this is a high priority request.

Thanks,
Whitney
