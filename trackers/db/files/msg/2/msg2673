Hi IT help,

For some strange reason, since I moved upstairs to the 6th floor, I have no printer drivers installed. I'd like to be able to print to the color printer and copier on the 4th floor if possible.

Please note, I am here the rest of the day today (Monday), Tuesday (after 12pm), and Thursday this week.

Thank you very, very much,

Julienne
