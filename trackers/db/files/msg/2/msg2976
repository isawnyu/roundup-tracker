Kathy happened to mention to me that she got on the ISAW website from her home computer (PC running Firefox browser), and the U with umlaut from Gunter Dreyer's name was missing.  It appears to be showing up in all the browsers I can try from my work computer so maybe it's an issue on her end, but I just wanted to let someone know in case it's on our side.

The page she noticed it on was http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/scholars.htm
