<p>Mike's computer is infected with FakeAgent.rgb which is a new rootkit/trojan that was recently released last week. It has infected 98% of the United States and seemingly no where else according to McAfee.&nbsp;They have just released an update for it's security data definition database yesterday. It's really a rather brilliant trojan in its function.. I'm cleaning this up now it's going to take sometime and then I must repair the master boot record. Hopefully this is fixed by then.. i doubt it was targeted.. but then again I can't be too sure. Looks like just another arms race rootkit.</p>
