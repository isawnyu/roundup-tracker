<p>Telecom finance has confirmed that we pay only the installation and activation fees, not a carrying charge. The price they quoted you was to activate the entire set now. It is currently $25 per line. To confirm, our total out of pocket cost to get these installed is $3,912 if we install and activate all the lines, less if we install them all and only activate some now.</p>
