Dear Mike,

The exhibitions department is hosting a musical performance on Thursday, April 8th, 7-8 PM, in the Lecture Hall. We are renting an upright piano that will be delivered on the 8th and picked up on the 9th. Could we please have the lecture hall filled to capacity with chairs? I think that this event is going to be very well attended so could we have additional chairs available that we can set up right outside the Lecture Hall. Dwayne helped us with this in the past. Is he available to stay on April 8 to help? 

As always please let me know if you want to go over the details in person.

Thank you,
Irene
