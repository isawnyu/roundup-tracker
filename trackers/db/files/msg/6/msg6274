<p>This extension cable has been added, hopefully it doesn't grow legs. I've left it in the scanner so people in-fact know it is there but it can be summoned via requisition if that works better as well. The scanner seems to be operating correctly for the most part. Otherwise I noticed that the computer itself was frozen, after I exited KIC. That is a sign of something more ominous if it's happening often; otherwise it was just a one off. I'll leave this ticket open for a week or so and then close out if all is well.</p>
