<p>Roger: <br /> <br />There was a delay in ordering this because it appeared not be available via iBuy but then as I pursued a p-card order it emerged it was buried amongst Dell's stuff, which is on i-Buy. <br /> <br />Anyway, should it be charged to operating or to your research account (or somewhere else)? <br /> <br />Thanks, <br />Tom <br /> </p>
