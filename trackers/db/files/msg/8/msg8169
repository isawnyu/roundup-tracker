<p>The slide scanner is not working.&nbsp; IT support has looked at it to no avail.&nbsp; Program crashes in the middle of a scan, sometimes hangs without opening, sometimes is apprently open without showing the screen that one needs to control the scanner.&nbsp; Have unplugged and plugged in the scanner, have turned the scanner off and on, have rebooted the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still can't scan a slide.</p>
