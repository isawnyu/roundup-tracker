<p>The plate seems precarious and Dawn brought it to my attention that it was still not functioning properly. If it works properly and the loose plate is is not a safety issue, then maybe Mike and Dawn can resolve between them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have submitted a separate ticket (#1492) to IT for your access, as mentioned on our call this morning.</p>
<p>The IT team can address how to make this work best for Mike as I'm sure there are expediencies I'm not aware of. Chris and Mike did have a training session in Sept., but I was not part of the discussion.</p>
<p>Best, Diane</p>
