<p>It is raining now and the roof is leaking. I have put post-its where the leaks are. They are not over the table this time (?) but in the curve in the roof line. I have buckets under the 3 drips in the large room and one in the small.</p>
<p>After 2 hours of raining, the table is dry.</p>
<p>Two of the three lights are also not lighting, but I believe this is totally unrelated.</p>
