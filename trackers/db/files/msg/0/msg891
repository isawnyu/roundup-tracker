Tim:

The university has re-negotiated its contract with TGI; I know that we spoke about the following things that need to be covered before you leave:

~ Deleting the isawevents account and keeping one general email address only that both 
Kate and Jess check: isaw@nyu.edu

~ Creating an affiliates list

~ Researching a method by which we can give users the option of receiving
plain text messages.

~ job description for Tech Work-Study
who will serve a both Digital Projects and Systems Support Role

~ Computer purchases and set up for Beate and David

~ Inventory of ISAW technical equipment and red flags on missing items / equipment that is disappearing.

I know need to add the replacement of the Copier on the fourth floor so that it is the equal/better model than what
is on 3. I must of course see prices/quotes first.

Thanks,
Suzan
