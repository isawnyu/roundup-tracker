<p>Your tickets are tickets that have only be assigned to you and not tickets that you open. Or in other words, the person who is actually able to do the work is whom the ticket belongs "The Assignee". I can see how that nomenclature is confusing, so I will switch it to "Assigned tickets" and make "Your Issues" tickets that are opened by the user.</p>
