<p>Kate:</p>
<p>I'm not sure what could be causing the login problem. Do you know how to dump/reset/clear the cache in your browser? If so, try that and see if it gets better. Whether that works or not, can you tell me what browser you're using?</p>
<p>I've confirmed that you have the proper permissions (owner) to edit that profile.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
