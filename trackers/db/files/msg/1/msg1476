Dear Tom,

Happy New Year. I hope you are well. Jennifer and David Anthony were on the Leonard Lopate Show, WNYC yesterday discussing the exhibition. When you have a chance, could you please put the link to the segment on the website? The direct link is http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/episodes/2010/01/14/segments/148072.

Thank you so much,
Irene
