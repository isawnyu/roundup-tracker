Since you informed us Christopher is not available now, I don't know who to turn for help, since I can't find the email address of Ben. Would you please tell me how can I contact Ben? Thank you.<br /><br />Best,<br />Fan</p>

<blockquote class="gmail_quote">Dear colleagues,<br /><br />During the next three to five weeks, Christopher Warner's time will be devoted mainly to two projects of critical importance to ISAW: changes to our server to resolve a number of security issues that threaten data integrity as our files become more complex; and migrating the community's calendar system to Google (a more complicated process than for an individual). During this period, he will respond to tickets only for emergencies. Routine user needs will be queued for our student assistant, Ben, who will take care of them as time allows. Please do not interrupt Christopher's work for such matters. I strongly encourage you to use the central NYU ITS helpdesk for computer matters that are not ISAW-specific, and I ask for your patience during this period.<br /><br />Roger<br /><span style="color: #888888;"><br />--<br />Roger S.
