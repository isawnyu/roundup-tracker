Hi Tiffany:

I think we need to have a meeting with Diane, myself and maybe a couple of others, plus follow-up discussion at Cabinet in order to address this issue, as policies and procedures original from several areas within the institute.

The general Policies and Procedures page at http://isaw.nyu.edu/about/policies-and-procedures is automatically generated. The actual documents themselves are the ones you find under &quot;admin and finance&quot; and other places (click on a link and then look at the location bar in your browser). The idea is provide a single place that people can find *all* procedures and policies, but the record copies of the policies are located in each division's portion of the website.

But I'll set up a meeting and we can talk through in more detail.

Tom
