<p>I had a technical emergency this afternoon and was grateful for Rohan's assistance. The Financial Planning office was insisting I use a function in PowerPoint that is not available on the Mac or Parallels versions (?) He validated that I was not losing my mind (debatable, I know). &nbsp;No action necessary - this is just to record in retrospect that his assistance was timely.</p>
<p>Thanks,&nbsp;Diane</p>
