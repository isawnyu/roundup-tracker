<p>I'd like to go ahead and close this ticket as I am assuming it relates to 1620 which is already an emergency. At least that is the only assumption that I can make, if this is correct let me know but I'll be downstairs shortly so maybe I can glean a little bit more information.That aside the email really doesn't help me as I simply was not part of the conversation. The email addresses stated in this email aren't listed and I simply have no idea what this is other than an excerpt pasted in a conversation that was being had.<br /><br />I'm sincerely trying to understand if this is just an email or if there is actually something here that requires my action.&nbsp;</p>
