Joan,

Your NYU NetID is primarily used to log on to the wireless network across the University. You now have a separate but similar account ID for services at ISAW.

Your ISAW copier code is:
0011

Your ISAW account credentials are:
User Name: jmw11
Password: 0011

These account credentials will allow you to sign on to the ISAW wiki located at http://serv1.isaw.nyu.edu. It is also used to set up calendaring, the address book, and instant messaging.

Instructions for setting up these services are located at http://serv1.isaw.nyu.edu/groups/isaw/wiki/64ef5/ISAW_Services_Setup_Matrix.html

Mac minis are available in the library on the fourth and fifth floors if you need an internet connection.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions by opening another ticket.

Best regards,
Michael Edgcumbe
ISAW IT
