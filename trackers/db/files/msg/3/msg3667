Peter:

I apologize for the delay. The original memory chip we ordered turned out to be the wrong part; I apologize for that mistake. The ordering process for the correct memory was delayed when last week tornadoes cut off power, phones and internet to the entire region of Alabama in which I live. I am putting the correct memory on a rush order this morning, and I'll keep you informed throughout the process. I understand your frustration and apologize.

Best,
Tom
