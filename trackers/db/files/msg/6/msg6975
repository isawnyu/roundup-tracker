<p>Tom and Chris,<br />Roger has asked that my weekly Cabinet reminder he be able to reply to the isaw-cabinet email address. I have the appointment set up with an email reminder to all of Cabinet, but can't see how to get isaw-cabinet as the email sender, so you can reply to it. Do you know how/if we can do this?<br />Diane</p>
