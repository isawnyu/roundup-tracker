<p>Diane,</p>
<p>That is a correct understanding, however I'm not going to put the telecom move request in until everything and everyone is settled with their required moves. If that is completed before August 20th then those request can be made. In the interim what I will do is have the phones moved by then.</p>
<p>I'll submit the request for Robert Hoyland sometime this week.</p>
