<p>I've introduced a new, public-facing view of the news content, which is now to be found at: <br /> <br /><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/news">http://isaw.nyu.edu/news</a></p>
<p>That's a collection, set to full view. I've added a link and RSS icon so as to alert users to the existence of the syndication on that collection.<br /> <br />This is now where you end up if you click on "news" in the upper right corner or "News Blog" under "About ISAW" in the main navigation thanks to strategic placement of a few link objects. It's much more visually accessible (and in the right order) than the news authoring folder,&nbsp; which was previously our only view of this content other than the rotating events/news widget on the front page. <br /> <br />That ugly original news folder (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/about/news">http://isaw.nyu.edu/about/news</a>) is still where one needs to go to create new news items, but the path to it is now shielded to anonymous visitors. It's now set true for "exclude from navigation" but I've added a published-internal link so that if you're logged into the site, you find an additional navigation item under "About ISAW" for it: "News Authoring".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm moving this ticket to "testing" status for a few days to make sure we don't have any problems or complaints.</p>
