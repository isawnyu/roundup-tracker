Kate's moving has kicked up quite a bit of dust and small debris on the counters and carpet of the 3rd floor reception area -- could Dwayne please vacuum and wipe down the counters around Kate's old work area and the window?

Also, I do not know if there is an easy way to have the reception area window cleaned, as I suspect most of the dirt is on the outside, but it also badly needs washing.

Thanks,
Whitney
