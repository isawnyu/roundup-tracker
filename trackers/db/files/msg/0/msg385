Thanks Tim. I already have a copy of Adobe Photoshop, that we bought last year (it's "CS3 Extended"). I'm likely at some point to want Illustrator, so what would be more cost effective: just buying Acrobat and Illustrator, or buying a package (even if it duplicates photoshop)? I wasn't able to tell from the price list what apps were in which of the packages, but maybe I didn't read close enough?
