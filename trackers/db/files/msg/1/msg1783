Tom,

The iPad order has been faxed to the computer store, and I've left a message with the buyer asking him to overnight it directly to ISAW from Apple if possible.  I've read reports that Apple has already sold through its launch supply, so we may not receive one before April 12th or so.  I'll try to get a handle on the actual ship date.
