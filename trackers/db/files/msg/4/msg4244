Hi Tom,

Is it possible to create a new email address (isaw_exhibitions@nyu.edu) that can be accessed by all members of the exhibitions department including gallery attendants? If so please let me know what additional information you require.

Thanks so much,
Irene

PS: Please disregard the other ticket I just created with the same request but with the wrong email address.
