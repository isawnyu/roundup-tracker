<p>Just sent this to Roger (9/1) -- awaiting response:</p>
<p>Roger: <br /> <br />So far I know of 4 people who want AUTOCAD: Alex, Lorenzo, Nico and Rod. Others may crop up between now and the end of next week, especially if I send a follow-up email. <br /> <br />We can give faculty with research budgets one of two options: <br /> <br />* Purchase as many one-year (13 months: September - September), single-machine licenses as they each want for $150(!) each. These can only be run on NYU-owned machines (one license per machine). Buy a new one every year you need it. Students and scholars can also make use of these licenses (though not for course work) but ONLY on NYU-owned machines. <br /> <br />* Purchase as many permanent single-user licenses as they want for $1,395 to run on any single machine desired. <br /> <br />So I'd propose we let Alex, Lorenzo and Rod figure out what they want to do given the above. For Nico I guess the $150 would have to come from Amheida? If any students or scholars crop up who want it, we'd have to get one of the $150 licenses and install it on a Windows machine somewhere. <br /> <br />There may be costs for Mac users who want Autocad but don't yet have parallels/windows. There is a brand new Mac version of Autocad, but it's not included in any of the NYU licensed deals, nor is it as full-featured as the Windows version. <br /> <br />Thoughts? <br /> <br />Tom&nbsp;</p>
