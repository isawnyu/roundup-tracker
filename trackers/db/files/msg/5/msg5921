<p>Sent to Meredith Randall in ITS on 9/24 (delay because Lorenzo has not responded to my requests for his needs and we were asked to consolidate our order; pushing ahead because of Nico's urgency):</p>

<p>Hi Meredith:</p>
<p>We need two copies, both for faculty members. The costs will go on different chartfields.</p>
<p>What information do you need for us to get moving? Chartfields? Licensee names and netids?</p>
<p>Note, there's a possibility a third faculty member will want a license as well, but he's in the field in Turkey until spring semester and has not responded to my queries.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Tom</p>
