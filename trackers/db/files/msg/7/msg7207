<p>Dear Tom and Chris,</p>
<p>This message follows my earlier conversation with Chris about my computer, which is having considerable problems in terms of both wirelss internet connectivity (although my office is right next to a wi-fi spot) and ability to read external hard-drives (this is a big issue and of high priority for my work). Chris told me he would inquire about the warranty for my laptop and let me know how to proceed.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Nico</p>
