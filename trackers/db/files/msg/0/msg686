Sorry this is late - For Thursday 4/23 by 4pm, we need:

Powerpoint setup in all 3 rooms 
The lecture and seminar rooms shouldn't be a problem, right?  They also want it in the library.  I know it's a pain, but would you be able to set up the projector the same as you did for the dental school event?  

Thanks and sorry again for the short notice!
