<p>The events are being serialized because isaw.nyu.edu is located in Colorado. That means the server zone is MST and all events are being set like that. This is a known problem and has been assigned ticket #10886 upstream, this aims to totally refactor events in plone. The package plone.app.event is expected in 4.3</p>
<p>However, the events in isaw.nyu.edu are custom built and considering ISAW isn't moving timezone's it's safe to serialize all events for EST. ics_view and vcs_view need to be overrided and a notice that all events are in EST would be useful. We could set the events based on the geographical ip but it just gets too messy and I suspect for patrons of ISAW there are too many use case where timezone collisions would occur.</p>
