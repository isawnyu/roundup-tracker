<p>Dell has agreed to replace this on their dime as a one-time only deal and is sending the replacement panel. Please try to avoid breaking this specific piece again as they will only replace the entire computer in such cases. The replacement isn't covered under warranty but as this is a one-time only deal they will not void warranty. Once the part arrives i'll need to break the machine down and replace it as they aren't sending a tech for this. I'll have to update on when I can do this.</p>
