<p>I have been getting knocked offline and asked to re-login at least 100 times today.&nbsp; Probably every 10 seconds.&nbsp; This is definitely affecting my ability to work effectively.&nbsp; Arg.</p>
<p>I know this complaint has already been made, but I couldn't find the ticket to amend it to.&nbsp; I also think that the user interface for starting a ticket is so circuitous and unintuitive that most people give up before submitting one--but that is a ticket for another day.</p>
