<p>Dear Christopher,<br /><br />As we discussed, the Exhibitions Department will need 1 (possibly 2) mac desktop all-in-ones from September 2012 - January 2013 to use as research kiosks as part of our fall show. They will need internet access, a mouse (no keyboard), and a limited access user so that our visitors can only access the webpage we set up.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Alexander</p>
