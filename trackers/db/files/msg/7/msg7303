<p>When the system was recently worked on, iPhoto disappeared from my dock. I have photos on my machine that were to be considered for use in the fifth anniversary document (this afternoon) that I cannot access.</p>
<p>Rohan just tried to install it on my machine and there is a version incompatibility with my machine. I am putting this ticket in at his direction.</p>
<p>Thx, Diane</p>
