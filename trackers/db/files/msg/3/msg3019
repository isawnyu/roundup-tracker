Diane,

Happy New Year!  I'm back today and catching up on the list.  I happened by the copier on my way upstairs this morning and checked on it.  It seems to be making copies, etc, so I wanted to make sure you felt the issue was resolved.  Have a look and let me know if it does anything unexpected?

Thanks,
Michael
