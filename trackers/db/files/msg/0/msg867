Dear Mike / Duane:

Whenever you have a moment, could you kindly take measurements for the
center table in the Oak Library and the square table in the center room?

At present, we rent linen for events at ISAW - but I'd like to have our own linen in stock which can simply be laundered.

Thank you,
Suzan
