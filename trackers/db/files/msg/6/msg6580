<p>Step II</p>
<p>I&nbsp;was proud to be able landing to this great great page (<a href="http://www.nyu.edu.ezproxy.its.nyu.edu/its/protected/#download">http://www.nyu.edu.ezproxy.its.nyu.edu/its/protected/#download</a>) but none of the two, 32 or 64 symantec, could be run. And when clicking with the right-click no 'run as administrator' option opened. Sorry, I failed. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>best,</p>
