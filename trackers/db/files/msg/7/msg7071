<p>The most important obstacle to my moving off my office PC and out of the PC world generally is the large number of legacy files that I have in forms that Mac programs will not read. The bulk of these are Nota Bene files dating to various versions from NB 2 to NB 8. There are also some Quattro Pro files. The NB files in many cases contain Greek. The program has an export utility that will write RTF files with Unicode Greek, but it requires each file to be opened, sometimes converted from NB for DOS into NB for Windows, and then exported into RTF (which I would ideally like then to turn into .docx).</p>
<p>One of our earlier tech assistants (Michael, maybe) bought a file conversion utility, but (I think) then asked for it back to try on something, and I don't think I ever got it back. Anyway, such things are available fairly readily. But I am doubtful that these could batch process NB files needing the multi-step process, with options, that I describe above. And the files are extremely numerous; I have no accurate count, but I would estimate more than a thousand. I am willing to hire a student to do this work.</p>
<p>NB 8, the last version I have, does not run under Windows 7, and I do not think it can run under Parallels. So it needs to be installed on a computer with XP or Vista, god help us. I would welcome some advice on a pathway and leads on someone who would do the work.</p>
