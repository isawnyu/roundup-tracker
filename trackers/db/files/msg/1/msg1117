Mehmoush,

I'd be happy to help you get acclimated to the University's tools.  The librarians are also a good resource if I'm not available.  I will be in the office today until 2:30 if you'd like to drop by room 509.

J-Stor is database that anyone inside NYU's internal network has access to.  If you are off-campus, you can proxy  in through a page of Bobst Library's website.  There are no individual user accounts per-se.

Best,
Michael
