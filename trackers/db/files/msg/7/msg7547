<p><span>Hi Chris,</span><br /><br /><span>We have a new RA, Anne Hrychuk Kontokosta. Her netid is ach233 and her university id is N16503390. She probably won't be around much until July, but it would be great if we could get her into the system and give her a copy code, etc. If you need more info, let me know.</span><br /><br /><span>Thanks!</span><br /><br /><span>Kate</span></p>
