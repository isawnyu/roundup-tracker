<p>Dear Chris,<br /><br />One of the things I'm working on at ISAW is a long term digital humanities project that uses modern handwriting recognition algorithms to analyze ancient manuscripts. There are currently two profs and two research assistants in MA who are assisting me with this. In order for this to work well off-site we are putting together a way for me to quickly verify my assistant's work. To do this, however, I need to get MySQL working properly on my mac here at ISAW. One of my assistants put together a PPt detailing how to install and modify this to work on my machine. But, even with this it's a little over my head. I was hoping you and I could arrange a time in the coming days during which you could help me set this up. I've forwarded my assistant's directions as I think this will make a lot more sense to you than me. Thanks...<br /><br />Best,<br />Michael</p>
