To clarify, Beate has access to the internet on her machine, but cannot access NYU home. I validated she can pull up other websites, including www.nyu.edu, but when you click on the NYU Home button, it provides a pleasant error message. This looks to me like an ITS issue. 
Tiffany and I are not having a problem.
