<p>Diane: what Christopher needs is a clearer problem statement, since he wasn't party to the other related cabinet-level emails and discussion and since the ticket pasted into the email doesn't include the addresses in question. I'll write what I think I understand below; please check, correct and/or amplify by appending to the ticket as appropriate, and also please indicate which addresses of Jennifer's you were trying to use. Thanks.</p>
<p>Note: I'm also adding Jennifer and Irene to this ticket so they're aware of it and get updates.</p>
<p>Problem: Diane is unable to invite Jennifer to meetings etc. using Google Calendar.</p>
<p>I wonder if this is possibly related to ticket #1620.</p>
