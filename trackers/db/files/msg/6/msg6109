<p>There was water pooled on the wooden table in the large conference room this morning (10/13/11). I can visibly see a trail of water where one of Diane's post-its from 3 weeks ago still hangs. In order to try to prevent further damage to the table, I have cleaned up the water and placed the plastic trash can on the table where the pool of water was.</p>
