Going forward any ITS telecommunications issue please open with ITS explicitly. As for the basement, kitchen, fire-alarm sometimes elevator (you'll want to open one of those next week) etc are an on-going problem and the issue is they always simply need to be reset.

As for checking phones to make sure they work. Not my jurisdiction, I normally try to help but I simply don't have the bandwidth or care factor as of current. Should this become more of an issue please escalate with Tom and or Stephanie.

Thanks!
