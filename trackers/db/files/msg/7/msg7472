<p>Thanks. Needless to say I didn't leave it running ever since, but suspended Parallels when I got back to the office last week. But I think the copy of Windows must have got messed up somehow, and I've had to depend on my laptop for Windows since. By the way, should I have an admin password for the Windows on my desktop machine? I never was asked for one before the upgrade.</p>
