<pre>Hi Tom:

Just to let you know, I am willing to wait for a new computer rather
than just have the hard-drive replaced (if the wait is on the shorter
side). I would rather have a working new machine than have problems
reoccurring due to the fact that my computer is an old lady and needs
organ transplants.  Please let me know your thoughts on this.

Best,

Jennifer</pre>
