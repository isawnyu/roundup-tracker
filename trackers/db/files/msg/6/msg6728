<p>Awhile ago there was some discussion about getting some portable speakers for the laptop to help with things like skype meetings. With all the discussion concerning teleconferencing I think this fell to the wayside. We've had cause recently to use skype in meetings again (and have more coming up soon) and it would be great to get a pair, especially for those meetings that will take place in offices. I'm not sure who should be ordering these, so let's discuss the appropriate permissions and method of ordering.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
