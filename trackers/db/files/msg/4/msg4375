Yes, ITS will start with the 3rd and 5th floors which will take sometime and then will finish with the basement. From my end I prefer that they at least start sometime in the afternoon on Friday with some warm bodies in the building as I will be able to tell what issues we can expect if any and prepare and plan appropriately. The basement can be handled on 4/23 or 4/24.

I expect the process to be seamless and will update with details when we nail down the dates.
