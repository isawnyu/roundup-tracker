I had a voice mail from Joe Hill, Customer Service at 3M
651-575-5788

They have the PO for the device we are buying from them.

They want to come and do a site visit to examine the "buried cable" situation we have in place, prior to installation.

Mike, can you call and arrange this for a time you can show it to them and explain what the plan is?

Thanks,

-Chuck-
