<p class="p1">Ok, not that I want to be a jackass but realistically we need to use auto discovery protocols for some of our setup, it's 2011. Entering the ip address of printers into 50 different computers every semester is getting a little tiresome and unfortunately the printers don't have wireless access themselves but do support bonjour/zeroconf. So in the interim, we'd like to use the natural support of the broadcast from bonjour on our subnet using a dedicated machine attached to both wireless and wired networks. Is there any policy against this?</p>
