Hi Michael,

The exhibitions department is hosting a film screening on January 28th, 7-9 in the Lecture Hall. The film is on a DVD. When you have a chance could you please show me how to play the DVD. It does not have to be the day of the film, really whenever is good for you. I am happy to set everything up myself on the 28th.

Thanks,
Irene
