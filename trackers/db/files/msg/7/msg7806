<p>This rebuild is currently completing, the caviar blues were replaced for caviar blacks of the same size, should something like this happen again at the very least we wouldn't have to pay for the new drives as the blues were in the 5 year window period. Groups data is safe and back online. The 2TB and 750 drives were raided together in jbod mode which gives us a total of 2.75 TB of extra space for whatever. The machine is in burnin for the night so we can be sure it's ok and backed up and I'll give it a fresh boot sometime tomorrow morning. I won't be available for most of Wednesday so should something happen it'll have to wait until Thursday but I suspect this is resolved; for now.</p>
