Hi, I'm trying to print stuff out and the info for setting up the printer on Windows is pretty difficult to follow, and apparently out of date. On the ISAW wiki the only option listed is Windows XP. I have Windows 7. I was able to find no less than 9 drivers on the Lanier site, and since I couldn't find any recommendations about which to use I just guessed. Then in step 19 of the instructions it says to open OEMSETUP but among the 473 files that the system says it unzipped I can't find it. 

Any way you could make the process a bit simpler or offer more guidance--perhaps even upfront, in the instructions--would be great.
