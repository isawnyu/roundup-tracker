Michael:

For a proposal we're preparing I'd like to know what it would cost to outfit a single Mac user with Parallels + Windows + MS Office (including MS Access).

Is that something you can research for me and get me the numbers? I don't want to make an order yet, but I'd like to have costs to budget.

Thanks,
Tom
