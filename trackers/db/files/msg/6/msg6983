<p>Based on the needs I recommend a 27-inch iMac but I'll include a PC option for the sake of comparison (the software prices remain the same). I'm not sure how hard or extensively pushed this machine will be. In the event that it's something that is going to be used often especially with Autocad then my recommendation will change to a MacPro tower. Sans that the current price configuration and setup are as follows (i've taken the liberty of rounding up to the nearest whole dollar) and this doesn't include any discounts NYU has with Apple/MS/Adobe etc:</p>
<p>AutoCad 2012- $4000.00 USD<br />Adobe CS5 Master Premium - $550.00 USD<br />MS Office 2011 - $150.00 USD<br />27 inch iMac - $2000.00 USD<br />Memory Upgrade for the 27 inch iMac &nbsp;(16GB) - $100.00 USD</p>
<p>Mac + Software total: 6,800 USD before taxes and discounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AutoCad 2012- $4000.00 USD<br />Adobe CS5 Master Premium - $550.00 USD<br />MS Office 2011 - $150.00 USD<br />Dell Precision T7500 Tower Workstation with 20 inch monitor and similar specifications to the 27 inch iMac - &nbsp;$3200.00 USD<br />Memory Upgrade for the Dell (4GB comes with 12GB) - $220.00 USD (this is something called ECC ram)<br /><br />Dell + Software total: &nbsp;8,120 USD before taxes and discounts.<br /><br />Should anyone have any questions or would like me to expound further and/or provide a configuration with the MacPro tower please let me know.</p>
