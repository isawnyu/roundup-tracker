<p>Hi Tom:</p>
<p>I am in Kazakhstan with my phone being the main way I should be able to communicate with the world. Its a new iphone from work, and I know irene had it set up for international use, but when I got to KZ it stopped receiving emails. In fact it says, "could not open cellular network," when I try to download emails. This happened the last time I was here and Christopher sent instructions on how to reset my phone. Is there anyway you can help? Otherwise, it will be difficult for my office to be in contact with me while I am here/</p>
<p><br />Thanks so much!</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>
