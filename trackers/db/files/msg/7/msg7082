<p>I don't think we need to hire a warm body for this when the computer can do the work for free.. We can record a macro and just export the data to rtf. After a quick summary overview of something called <a title="AutoHotKey" href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" target="_blank">autohotkey</a>&nbsp;I don't see any difficulty in doing this when I get a chance. Of course I'd need to go through the annoyance of installing NB on our office windows laptop and getting all of your files, but beyond that. It should be pretty straight forward. I should have a little window towards the beginning of next week March 19th if you'd like to have the NB files ready. I'll have Rohan install NB on the windows laptop here and we'll this autohotkey/macro recorder for a spin. Fortunately it's opensource so should I experience any regression we can fix along the way. If I feel like i'm going to have to invest a huge amount of time we'll abandon this plan and come up with something else.</p>
