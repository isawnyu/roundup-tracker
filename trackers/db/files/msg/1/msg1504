I missed this in email, but found it late last week. Work had to be deferred until the migration of the amheida website repository (then already in progress) was complete. It has just been completed and I will act on this shortly. T.


Hi Tom,
This is Ellen Morris, the Academic Director for the Amheida study abroad program.  Would it be possible for you to substitute a link to the attached pdf for the current one in the Bibliographies tab at the left side of the main page (http://www.amheida.org/).  This version is much updated and will be useful for the students in the field.
Thanks a lot.
Best,
- Ellen
