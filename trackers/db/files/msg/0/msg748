Tim: thanks for your help in getting the Kansa/Heath lectures recorded. I think we'd like to proceed toward posting these as podcasts and based on past discussion I know they need some editing. Can you undertake to do that and I'll contact WebCom about what it takes to get them posted to ITunes University. Let me know if there are any difficulties or questions. Thanks.
