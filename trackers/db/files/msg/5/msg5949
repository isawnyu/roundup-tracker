<p>Excellent; it's very easy to use!</p>
<p>I've just set up a set of pages for the Commission for the History of Ancient and Medieval Astronomy (my main duty as president it seems), consisting of just information, links, and some downloadable newsletters and forms. I'd like to make this public as soon as possible, since the present Google-based website, which I also maintain, is inaccessible in some places (in particular China, where we have several members). I marked the main page as ready for review for publication; should I do so for the various subpages too? (They're linked at the bottom of the home page.) What about the image, text, and pdf files?</p>
<p>Also, will the public URL be the same as the one I see as "owner", i.e.&nbsp;</p>
