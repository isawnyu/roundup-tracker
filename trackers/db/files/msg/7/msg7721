<p>Depending on when the drives arrive I will be shutting down ISAW server, making backups and managing the migration of data to the new drives and rebuilding the raid from there. I suspect this will be a standard process and i'll need to update on when it will actually take place. I'm hoping the drives arrive tomorrow, if it's Thursday then the migration will have to wait until mid next week sometime. I should probably note again, this will indeed happen again and does not solve the immediate issues at hand but then that would put us back to normal. So, after this is complete I will be tagging this issue as resolved. 1741 still exists in deferred status.</p>
