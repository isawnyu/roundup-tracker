<p>Tom, (sent by email)</p>
<p><br />On behalf of all of us, we need something in place asap. If that means that we get the old form to start with, that's okay.&nbsp;We did not stop booking events, we just have to use other means to get the same data. So, please resurrect the dead and we'll worry about the reincarnation later.</p>
<p>It would be helpful to get your team's priorities on getting it upgraded. That way, we won't pester you unecessarily.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Diane</p>
