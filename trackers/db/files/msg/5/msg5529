<p>Kate:</p>
<p>On the "events" page (which is really a "folder"), click on the "contents" tab. You should then be able to drag-and-drop the events into whatever order you like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you'd like to have some automatic sorting behavior here, let's use the above as a work-around but make a comment to that effect on the ticket and leave the ticket open till Christopher gets back and we can prioritize making the change.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
