This will go ahead 18 June, between noon and 6 p.m. There is no need for an ISAW IT person to be present, in my judgment. Diane is coordinating to make sure there is a guard on duty. Keeping ticket open as a reminder to alert everyone in the first weeks of June, since the building will be closed (apart from the guard and ITS installers) during this time.
