In mid May, I will take a research trip to Kazakhstan and will need to bring a computer. I could bring the department laptop, or my personal computer. The ISAW computer is older and slower than mine, but has on it FileMaker Pro, a program I will need to use while away.  My computer is newer and faster, has Photoshop installed (which I will also need), but not FM Pro.  Is it possible for you to install FM Pro on my computer? or less desirably, Photoshop on the ISAW computer?  thanks, Peter
