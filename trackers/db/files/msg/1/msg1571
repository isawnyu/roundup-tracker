Dear Tom,

Tomorrow the exhibitions department was scheduled to host a lecture by Peter Biehl but due to the weather we will have to reschedule. We hope to have a new date soon however for the moment would you please change the date of the lecture to read canceled due to inclement weather new date TBD on both the exhibitions website (http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/exhibitions/oldeurope/publicprograms.html) and ISAW's events page (http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/events.htm). 

Thank you,
Irene
