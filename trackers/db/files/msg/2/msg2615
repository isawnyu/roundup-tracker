Thanks Michael. I did try the link you provided, but my phone calendar just did a "sit and spin". Googling seems to indicate that this is a widespread, known problem on Android. I also tried pulling in that URL to google calendars (which my Android of course can read), but the import to google failed there too.

Presently, I've got a manual workaround in place so this is not a high priority issue.
