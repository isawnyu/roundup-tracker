L.S.,

The air conditioning on the fourth floor (and I suspect on other floors as well) is not working at all. Consequently, the heat makes ISAW currently not a building conducive to studying. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate it if the air conditioning could be repaired as soon as possible.

Good luck and thank you,

Erik
