I've placed orders for all the needed hardware* via iBuy. I'll follow up in the next couple of days by getting our software house in order. 

* I have not ordered the display adapter that we'll likely need to hook the second monitor to the computer so we can make sure we know what we're dealing with (the monitor will probably come in before the iMac).

Best,
Tom
