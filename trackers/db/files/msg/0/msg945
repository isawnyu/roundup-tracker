Tim, please direct me in how to change my ISAW Wiki password. I've looked over the site but I can't seem to find a way to change it myself; is it something I need you to do for me? If that's the case, please change it to the following: if the new password doesn't need a number, then I'd like to change it to 'mulberry', or if it needs a number, 'mulberry1' would be great. If I've missed how to do this myself, please guide me through the process as I'm a bit lost. Thanks!
