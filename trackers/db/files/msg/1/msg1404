Mike:

Muriel Debie and David Taylor have begun working from room 403 on a more consistent basis (this is the husband-wife team). Originally, they were never there at the same time, so there was no problem about there being enough room in the office.

However, they need an additional surface / table as soon as possible. I noticed there was a folding table against the wall outside your office. Is it possible to move the folding table to room 403? It won't look "pretty" by any means, but I don't see any other alternative. I don;t think it's wise to purchase a writing table since it would not be used thereafter.

Thanks,
Suzan
