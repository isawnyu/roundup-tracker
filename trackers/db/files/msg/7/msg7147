<p>Diane has been using serv1.isaw.nyu.edu which is running AFS for all of ISAW to share and edit files. This is ok when it works but it doesn't really work that well do to AFS/HFS+ itself. There are locking errors, permission errors etc etc etc. Sadly, this is increasingly becoming an issue as Exhibitions has denoted problems over time as well and I don't see it getting any better until Apple actually decides a filesystem from 1986 is not that useful anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a well known issue with Apple's Filesystem for server or group work. &nbsp;I've implemented ZFS to combat some of these issues in other environments up to 128TB of data as it is a relatively stable and useful filesystem. It is in usage here at ISAW for RAIDZ backup of our ticket system. Which to date, there have been approximately zero issues and we are on day 186 and counting. Or, since the day I deemed it production ready.</p>
<p>I'm going to field test a paired 2TB external setup connected to automaton.isaw.nyu.edu and ZFS filesystem mounted via Apple File Protocol as a share for her to work around these issues temporarily. Primarily because if it's something critical i'd rather a copy of it at least be on something a bit more stable. So two external 2TB drives formatted ZFS RAIDZ and connected to our most stable server resource using netatalk.</p>
<p>From there I'll come up with a more precise game plan as to some form of migration process for all of our Groups data to a different server using ZFS. This will affect all staff at ISAW and I'm not sure of the cost yet, if I can just utilize our existing external jbod I will. It will most likely take a week or two of my time in preparation, planning, deployment etc. I'm going to defer it as I don't have time to employ this just yet and have other things on my plate. However this has been an annoyance for sometime now and it will only devolve into a bigger issue. Fortunately I'm a realist living in the year 2012 so I have much other interesting things I could be doing with my time here at ISAW than playing with a filesystem that really hasn't been updated since 1986. I'll update when I've got the first pairing complete for testing and we'll itemize from there.</p>
