<p>We're working on getting a backup PC laptop to use as a loaner while PCs, like yours, are sent out for repair. We're working on costing now and should be able to order soon. There is one system ahead of yours in the queue, which is suffering near-catastrophic problems. This note is just to let you know we're still working the problem, and we'll let you know as soon as we have a timeline.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
