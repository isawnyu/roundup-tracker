Unfortunately the first two have problems.

1. Includes a dock where the drive is attached, this is unacceptable for numerous reasons but the main one being that the board inside isn't hot swap capable. It's just a silly design for such a thing.

2. The manufacturers product number ST320005EXA101-RK receives at best 3 star ratings. Which means it most likely has a high failure rate or other major problems.

3. Most of the issues seem to be with the actual backup software which we won't be needing anyway. The failure rate for the actual hardware seems to be low which is the important piece here.

Option 3 is obviously the most expensive option at $119.99 USD but considering the previous options are only $20.00 USD cheaper and we are talking about backup's here it only seems the logical choice.
