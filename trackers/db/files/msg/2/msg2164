Hi Tom,

I got a request from Shelby to put up the info on the Lod Mosaic event, 
so I'll put the copy below. Unfortunately as Suzan handled this type of 
stuff before I didn't realize it was a public event when I sent you the 
main stuff. Sorry and many thanks. I just have the basics now, as soon 
as I find out the specifics I'll let you know. Shelby just wanted to 
make sure it was on the calendar.

October 2: Lod Mosaic Roundtable
Location: 2nd floor lecture hall
Date: Saturday, October 2
Time: 10:30-am-12:30pm
