Zoe,

I'd be happy to help get the printer setup.  i am here until 11 this morning (thursday) if you would like some help adding the printer.  If you are comfortable doing it yourself, the IP address is 128.122.167.40 and the model is Lanier LD 345.  If we happen to miss each other, I'll be in the office again on Monday from 10 to 2.

Best,
Michael
