A conundrum: On both my home desktop and my traveling Macbook Air I run Windows XP, with regularly updated versions of Firefox as the browser, as well as Thunderbird as the email client. Both have Adobe Acrobat Reader 9 installed. 

When I get a PDF file as an attachment by email or click on a PDF file on a web site, on the laptop the file opens correctly in Acrobat. On the desktop, however, it "opens" with Microsoft Picture Manager, providing only an image of an Acrobat icon. It does this even if I specify "open with Acrobat 9.3" in the dialog box. I have looked at every possible setting and cannot see why it does this--and the laptop doesn't.

No doubt the ultimate solution is to throw away the home desktop, but I'm really not ready to face that time-eating proposition yet. Any ideas?
