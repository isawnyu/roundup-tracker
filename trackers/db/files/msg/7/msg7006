<p>As a note to myself, Varnish was upgraded from 2.1.5 to 3.0.2 and jscrollpane was used for the events content scroll so it's available everywhere. There is a bug in Plone where if a file is compressed and over around 70kb, Zope will refuse the object to the caching server. This is a known bug and even though it's been noted as not a huge issue, due to the fact that Nginx or Apache can handle compression. It is actually a huge issue because in this case "jquery" being the culprit is simply not going to be getting any smaller; ever and I'd like to upgrade that in the future should we move the editing piece of this off of Plone and come up with a better UI. That aside jScrollPane fails gracefully and will default to system/browser widgets.</p>
<p>This process also exposed a bug in Varnish, hence the upgrade to 3.0.2 and the fix of the caching issue. It was probably hightime anyway as 2.1.5 was a bit long in tooth. The fix was plagued with numerous headers being cached by Varnish, so I wrote explicit rules for that. One should be able to login/logout and not have to worry about reloading the page etc.</p>
<p>obj.cacheable was deprecated and removed completely replaced with a ttl variable. I'm not sure why.. obj.cachable made lots of sense.<br />pass was deprecated for hit.for.pass, again.. I mean.. pass made lots of sense and was universally understandable by anyone.</p>
<p>etc.</p>
