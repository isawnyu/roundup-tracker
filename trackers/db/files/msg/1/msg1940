Hi Chris/Mike:

I'd like to request assistance for IT/Projector/Mic set up for two events

1. The Kern Lecture tomorrow, May 24 
4:00 pm set up (with me) if possible

2. June 1st, ARCE, with Ann Macy Roth, 4:00 pm set up.
I will email Ann tonight and ask her to please send the slides in advance.

Thank you,
Suzan
