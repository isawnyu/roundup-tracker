<p>After my machine has been upgraded to Lion: My virtual machine isn't working anymore, I'm getting a message that virtualization has been disbled on my mac. I need to prepare the 1st quarter report for LLF and this is hindering my work. Also, I'm not comfortable with the new email layout in Mail, wondering if someone can assist me with changing it, I can't seem to access all of my prior emails now.</p>
