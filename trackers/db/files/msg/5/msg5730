<p>I just had a conversation with Jennifer and we will move with ordering a new machine on Tuesday. What I will do is hold onto the hard drive until the computer has indeed been ordered. Afterwards we can schedule a return, even though having an extra hard drive around maybe useful. I can't think of any immediate need to have it.</p>
