<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm having issues with my own calendar and within our department as well (in terms of viewing other's calendars within exhibitions). We are finding, for example, that what we see on Jennifer's calendar does not match what she sees on her calendar etc... Also, my phone is no longer showing my NYU calendar. If I could sit down with someone to sort this out sometime next week that'd be fantastic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very best,<br />Julienne &nbsp;</p>
