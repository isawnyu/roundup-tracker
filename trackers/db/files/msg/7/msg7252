<p>Please have Dwayne bring up the two 6ft tables and one 8ft table to the lecture hall on Friday, April 20th. I need them set up in the lecture hall for the conference Monday. They will need to be taken down on Tuesday morning and the chairs replaced for an event Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
