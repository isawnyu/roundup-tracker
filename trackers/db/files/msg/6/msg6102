<p>Hello Nishad,<br />The error that we receive is a 403 Forbidden error (403 status code),<br />which means if 216.165.95.70 is blacklisted that we would have to<br />remove it from whatever module or routine you are using via Apache to<br />blacklist. Sans that, there is absolutely nothing that we can do on<br />our end. A 403 Status return comes from UCI's own webserver at<br /><a href="http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/" target="_blank">stephanus.tlg.uci.edu</a>&nbsp;which informs us we don't have access to the<br />following path /indiv/weblogin<br /><br />If you can put me into contact with the person who knows about the<br />module setup so I can either inform the appropriate blacklist<br />dnsbl/rbl that 216.165.95.70 is indeed a legitimate address and/or<br />that ip can be whitelisted via your setup I'd appreciate it as again,<br />there is not much we can do with a 403 status code as we don't have<br />control over&nbsp;<a href="http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/" target="_blank">stephanus.tlg.uci.edu</a><br /><br />Thanks!<br /><span style="color: #888888;">--<br />Christopher Warner<br /><a href="http://cwarner.kernelcode.com/" target="_blank">http://cwarner.kernelcode.com</a></span></p>
