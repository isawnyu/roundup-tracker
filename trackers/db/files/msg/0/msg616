Like the guest curators, I am also noticing rapid increases in temperature in the Library space.  They reported this happening about 6 pm, I noticed it when I arrived this morning about 8:45.  I have not noticed it at other ties of the day.  All air vents were blowing hot air and the space was very warm, especially on the top level.  An hour later the vents are blowing cooler air, and the space is more comfortable, but there is a noticeable temperature differential between the upper and lower levels.
