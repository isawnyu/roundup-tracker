<p>Since it takes about 30 minutes to boot up parallels on my own machine, I have been using the second computer at reception to run my reports and it is now giving me issues. I have called ITS and they say Brio is working, and that I need to just keep clearing my cache/cookies and retrying it, but I can't figure out where to do that on the computer in parallels. Please help!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
