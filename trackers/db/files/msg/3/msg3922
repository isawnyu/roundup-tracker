Judith forgot her main administrator password to her new Macbook unfortunately the Snow Leopard DVD's we have do not support the i7 processor so we receive kernel panics in an attempt to reset the password. 

Will temporarily add Judith to the NYU-GUEST network and she will have to either reset the password with the install disc that came with her Macbook or completely reinstall the operating system.

Advised Judith that she should be able to just take it to the Genius bar and have her administrator password reset to whatever she wants.

From there she will need to be setup for the printers.
