One more new VRS, Jonathan Ben-Dov, is now at ISAW. He has met with HR and has a netid. I got him set up with the wireless, but am wondering how to get him access to the printer, which I'm sure he will be asking me about next. I know there are directions on the wiki, but of course he doesn't have access yet. How should he proceed?

Thanks!
Kate
