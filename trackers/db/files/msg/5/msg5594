<p>Hi Chris --<br />I am having problems with my computer in regards saving filemaker docs as pdfs, and a few other things. Irene says there's a history of problems with this computer. Can you let me know when you can look at this?</p>
<p>Also, I have tried to email a document from the 6th floor scanner/copier. When I did it, it gave the sent-by address as Linda Stubbs' gmail address. We'll need this changed.....</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Batja</p>
