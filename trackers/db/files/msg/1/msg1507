Amheida: While you're replacing the bibliography, could we fix the horrible way that the link for the dighouse library is handled. It is buried under Student Information/Academic Resources/Dighouse Library, and what's there is an out of date fixed file. The most current version is at Columbia, http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/indiv/papyrus/dakleh_oasis_library.html, and we should link to that rather than maintaining our own copy in dead form. I'd also like to have the link at a higher level, preferably on the front page (not only students might want to know, after all).
