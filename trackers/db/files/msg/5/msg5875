<p>Mike &amp; Dwayne,</p>
<p>As we discussed, there will be an internal conference in the lecture hall of Friday, September 23 and I will need the lecture hall chairs set up again in there by 10am. On Saturday, the seminar room will be used all day, so the remaining chairs and oak library furniture should be moved out by then.</p>
<p>Thanks, Kate</p>
