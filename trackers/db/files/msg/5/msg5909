<p>Automaton now has a ZFS raidz pool called "heron" made from ad10 and ad14 the lay out currently looks like:</p>

<div>Where we have about 916G available, <strong>/heron/ticket.isaw.nyu.edu</strong> is set to keep two copies of the data which ensures we have double redundancy. I still need to write a script that automatically takes a snapshot of the file system daily but I'll get around to that after we have a bit of a burn in period for the drives, i'll then resolve this.</div>
