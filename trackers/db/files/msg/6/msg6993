<p>Our speaker for the Rostovtzeff series has requested that we load the VLC Media Player onto the laptop for the lecture so that she can show film footage she has. It's free software.The first lecture is on March 1st (next Thursday), so if we could do this early next week, that would be ideal.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
