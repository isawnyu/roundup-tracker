<p>Just had a conversation about this and essenatially Exhibitions is going to need support for the equipment they are setting up. NYU policy doesn't allow for external firewalls, switches etc.. I'll see what I can do. In the meantime we'll have to discuss how this is going to be supported etc as quite frankly the end of August install makes it highly likely that 1. I will not be here or 2. If for some reason I am in actual fact here at ISAW i'm sure it will not get done.</p>
<p>I'm cc'n Tom. The equipment in specific is the FVS318 Netgear box.. it's not here yet but other than that as stated I'll begin this conversation. Bumping this to high.</p>
