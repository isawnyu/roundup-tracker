<p>i've had a couple of informal questions from a few people along similar lines. I've been telling them to look at both the "sharing" and the "state" menu in order to control who can see/edit what. I try to find the right balance of encouraging them to figure it out on their own and going to Chris if they're totally lost. And I think this mostly pertains to people's future plans.</p>
