<p>Hello Chris,</p>
<p>I spoke to Rohan and he told me he contacted Microsoft. In order to solve the problem, they need the id/email address of the account holder for Office, but did not recognize your email address (nor Tom's). Any advice? There are two days left for the activation now...</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Nico</p>
