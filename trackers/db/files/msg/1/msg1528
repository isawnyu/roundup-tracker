HI Michael,

So I have installed this and I now need to know what comes next because I get the same thing as Thunderbird which is, it just opens up and doesn't prompt me for a under id or password.  I can't sign into Roger's calendar.

I'm home today and tomorrow and I need to get this access going - Shelby White's assistant called me earlier about getting something on the calendar for next week for Roger, Shelby and Dean Mcloughlin - and I can't even see Roger's calendar - that's bad.

Thanks,
Elizabeth
