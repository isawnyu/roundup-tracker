<p>I know that the issues with the events page have been deferred 'indefinitely', but I have finally hit an event that I need some assistance with. I am trying to put in an event that will consist of a 3-person panel where each person will have their own presentation, etc. With the current state of the events page, all this information gets globbed into 2 giant run-on paragraphs that are not readable at all. If this cannot be fixed soon, is there some work around you can suggest so that I can get the information posted in a readable manner? Here is what it currently would look like on the event page: <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/events/isaw-the-american-turkish-society-a-panel-on-conservation-in-turkey/">http://isaw.nyu.edu/events/isaw-the-american-turkish-society-a-panel-on-conservation-in-turkey/</a></p>
<p>I would still need to add 2 bios and 2 presentation titles.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Kate</p>
