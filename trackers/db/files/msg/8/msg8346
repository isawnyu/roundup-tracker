<p>From time to time this morning, my cursor is taking off on its own, looking the way it did once when Christopher had taken remote control of it in order to fix something. Little ovals periodically appear saying "connection lost". Something weird is going on, and I am worried that it could be something sinister. Or is Christopher playing with my desktop?</p>
