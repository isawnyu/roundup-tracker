<p>This server is now in a stable and halfway usable state; the users directory has to be moved still; backups are occurring religiously, frequently and for the right directories (expired backups are deleted based on change). &nbsp;Surprisingly this change is often; the heaviest users of this sever belongs to the Exhibitions team. Mail and iChat services have been turned off. Print serving has been enabled for the 4th and 6th floor enabling the work around due to the constraints of the NYU-NET bridge policy. This enables anyone to add the printers from anywhere in the world. I will probably need to go about assigning those proper domain names, 4thprinter.isaw.nyu.edu or some such. Spotlight and indexing on this machine is functional again. The fact that the machine didn't find itself in a full cpu meltdown everyday is surprising to me, luckily a bug in the indexer prevented a more serious issue (I should report this but I don't have time to fix Apple's indexing daemon). Permissions will still need to be worked out as I wait to hear about problems. So far the Exhibitions group have been the only vocal ones. I suspect the administrative group may have issues but I'm waiting to hear.</p>
<p>Really the name of this machine is lacking. Serv1 is really a poor choice for a server name as it doesn't describe anything that it in-fact does and it is simply not apart of a cluster. Unfortunately changing it at this point would involve too much pain... primarily for me. &nbsp;The main raid array and the groups drive had a couple of journal replays sans restart but nothing that I would be concerned about. Most likely boils down to hfs+ really needing to be taken out back.</p>
<p>The logs from this server need to be sent to a central logging server; that will obviously be automaton.isaw.nyu.edu. Now that I'm thinking about it, isaw4.atlantides.org should be reporting to automaton as well. Need to setup a ticket for that.. I've created a slice called "archive" on serv1, where i'm putting all the obvious items that are of no immediate need but look like they maybe useful reference material.</p>
<p>There is still much to do here, but it's starting to look like a resource people can use.</p>
