I'm planning to have seminar meetings in both semesters next academic year in which I'd like to be able to have a colleague at Brown University participate by video conferencing. Can we have a discussion some time about how this can best be done? 

It would be ideal not to have the conferencing completely tie up the screen in our seminar room since people might want to use it for Powerpoint or the like. Also, I'd like the remote colleague to be able to see the whole seminar group, not just one person in front of a laptop webcam.
