<p>Hello Lorenzo,</p>
<p>To get Symantec and install it from ITS you have to visit this URL <a title="Symantec Anti Virus" href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/software/#security" target="_blank">http://www.nyu.edu/its/software/#security</a>&nbsp;<br />You have Windows 7 installed so it automatically comes with Windows Defender and it has been enabled.<br /><br />Unfortunately Windows 7 doesn't have any backup solution builtin that would back up removable media on the fly. I recommend using something like <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">http://www.dropbox.com</a>&nbsp; or some other sort of "cloud drive" in order to make sure your transient data is backed up accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
