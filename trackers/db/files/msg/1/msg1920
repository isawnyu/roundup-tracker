Friday late afternoon I received a call from you and this morning from Linda that the exhibition room on the first floor has to be plastered and painted because Shaulby has a dinner in that room tonight.
In my opinion someone should of took the responsibility to let me know right away not last minute what is going on and what needs to be done in the building.
I am sure someone probably knew about this weeks ago and did not tell me.
