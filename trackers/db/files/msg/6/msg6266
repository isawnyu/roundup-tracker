<p>We should now have a uniform set of Google resource calendars matching our rooms, plus one for ISAW holidays and one for all-building events. Whitney, Christopher, Diane and Kate should be able to see all of them in their google calendar interface when logged in with their NYU accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are still missing one calendar: the Lecture Hall. It exists, but I don't have control over it yet. &nbsp;I've put in a request transfer of control to me. Once that's done I'll &nbsp;adjust the sharing just like the rest of these.</p>
<p>Please let us know (by appending to this ticket) if you cannot see the following calendars in your Google calendar lists:</p>
<p>ISAW: Events<br />ISAW: Gallery 1<br />ISAW: Gallery 2<br />ISAW: Holidays<br />ISAW: Large Conference Room<br />ISAW: Oak Library<br />ISAW: Seminar Room<br />ISAW: Small Conference Room&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll shortly be opening another ticket to ask ITS to get the names used in the resource allocation menu of the event creation form to match up better with these.</p>
