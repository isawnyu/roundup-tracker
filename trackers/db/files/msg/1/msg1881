Hi Michael,
I am having a problem logging in to Thunderbird.  The application asks for my user name and password over and over again.  Eventually, I am able to cancel the password request, but then I do not have access to the ISAW calendar.
Also, the archiving plan for email messages almost worked, but I need you to take a look at a peculiar development.
Thanks,
Dawn
