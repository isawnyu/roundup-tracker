<p>From Lorenzo d'Alfonso on 9/28:</p>
<p>Just to tell you that we could not use today 6th flor small conference<br />room because teh neon is not working properly. We moved to teh big<br />room, but also there only one of the two lamps works. My feeling is<br />that you should ask Mike to check and eventually fix it.</p>
<p>Best,<br />Lorenzo</p>
