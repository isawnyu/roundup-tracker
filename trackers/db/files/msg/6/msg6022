<p>This machine may need a new ram module, see ticket 1434. It's currently operational but should it happen again the ram may either need to be reseated or a new module purchased for this machine. It curerntly has what looks like an upgraded 2GB DDR3 module in both banks for a total of 4GB non ecc memory. Will monitor with Beate to see if it does indeed happen again.</p>
