The red voicemail light of my phone is on, but I've never had to check it in my few months here and no one seems to know the password for this line to be able to access NYU's voicemail system. Is there anyway that IT could look into it? 

Note: This inquiry is about line ext. 27843, not the general ISAW line (27800) which I check regularly. Thanks!
