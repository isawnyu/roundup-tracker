<p>Chris,</p>
<p>Unfortunately this type of configuration (manual configured static<br />routes) is not supported on NYU-NET. While on the surface such an<br />addition appears technically feasible, there are several plans,<br />designs, and configurations in place that prevent the use of such a<br />configuration. The wireless networks for WAN sites (such as ISAW, 15<br />East 84th St.) are generally *not* present at the physical location,<br />instead traffic is tunneled back to central wireless controllers for<br />management and connectivity. Additionally, we utilize dynamic routing<br />protocols for the distribution of networks across campus; the addition<br />of static routes complicates the overall routing design/functionality<br />and are used only when necessary for network management.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Chris</p>
