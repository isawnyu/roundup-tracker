<p>After speaking w/Tom, I'll do a little updating on the publications listed at&nbsp;<a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/publications">http://isaw.nyu.edu/publications</a>&nbsp;. But I need permissions. And then just as a reminder, I also have edit permissions on&nbsp;<a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/publications/isaw-papers">http://isaw.nyu.edu/publications/isaw-papers</a>&nbsp;, is it cleaner to give me permission to the whole permissions folder and its contents?</p>
