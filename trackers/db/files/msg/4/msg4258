Spoke with Irene about this and it's not an alias but an email account; a request has been put in for exhibitions.isaw@nyu.edu

For the ticket:

One may being saying to themselves why exhibitions.isaw@nyu.edu and not isaw.exhibitions@nyu.edu

Well we've been keeping with the theme of isaw.*@nyu.edu alias for email forwards to departments. Exhibitions doesn't currently use isaw.exhibitions@nyu.edu but it's quite possible someday they will. In that event, then it's possible. 

On the other hand if we create isaw.exhibitions@nyu.edu as just an account in the future should things change it will become a hassle to manage migration. Considering it will most likely be confusing to the admins of ITS who may or may not be continuous students cycling through every 6-12 months.
