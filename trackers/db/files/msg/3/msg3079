6th floor printer alcove:
Please hook up the network connection for 2 printers: the large copier/printer/scanner and the HP color printer, both currently resident on the 3rd floor. 
Mike has punched through the wall (a large hole) and is going to repair the sheetrock by Wed. Please let Diane know when this is "live". She will be scheduling with TGI to move the large printer once the room and the connections are ready.
