<p>Bumping up the priority and changing status to "more info" because of discussion going on in email. Reports from the administration team are as follows:</p>
<p>1. On reflection, form is judged to be too long and complicated for in-house users to be likely to use</p>
<p>2. Spreadsheet is too cumbersome for administration team to use; need results forwarded in email</p>
<p>RE item 1, I've said that it would probably be pretty quick to whip up a new, simpler form for in-house people to use, but I would need specifications from the administration team as they provided for the form that is now judged to be too complicated.</p>
<p>RE item 2, google forms provides notification natively, but not forwarding of results via email. This would have to be programmed on, and we don't have resources at present to &nbsp;pursue. I have asked whether working with the spreadsheet would be possible as an interim measure.</p>
