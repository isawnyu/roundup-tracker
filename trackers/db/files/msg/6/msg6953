<p>You can't delete a file from the individual drop down. Why that doesn't work, I have no idea. It just sits there with a cancel spinner. The workaround involves deleting from the more action menu.<br /><br />I'm going to give the drive an allotment of 5 more irritating irking behavior slots for me to check off. Should it reach that threshold my recommendation will be to throw it from the 6th floor onto the pavement below. In the sake of trying to stay objective and because I know Roger wanted to give this thing a run i'll wait until the end of the week, even should that threshold be reached.<br /><br />Should that occur as to a replacement device that would be useful we'll have to investigate our options. I haven't spent much time dealing with cloud storage besides the SOP sort of apps, dropbox etc. So it's something I'll try to spend some cycles on next week.</p>
