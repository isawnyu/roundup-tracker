If this doesn't work for whatever reason Michael please don't spend any large amount of time on it. If portable firefox is failing it's because it's adding settings onto the hd or requiring old libraries that have been deprecated for whatever reason. Either way, we shouldn't have a situation where an os upgrade is behind because of a user space application.

If Lilian wants to talk about it let me know; Also i'm not sure about the encryption situation. Quite frankly, anything on her laptop hd is decryptable but if it's causing problems for whatever reason she needs to provide the password to decrypt so you can do whatever you need to.
