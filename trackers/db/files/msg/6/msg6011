<p>Chris,</p>
<p>I cannot get the adv. search function on the ticketing system to pull up ticket #1310, which was a request to create a folder for W-9 forms for a number of administrators. The folder was created as Volumes/Groups/Forms/W9</p>
<p>However, no one can put files in the folder and this is now unfortunately urgent.</p>
