Hi Tom, a couple of additions:

Lod Mosaic titles:
Miriam Avissar: "The Enigma of the Lod Mosaic Floors - Interpretation, Context, and Chronology"
Jacques Neguer: "Conservation of mosaics for public display"
*please change Christopher Lightfoot's role to 'moderator'

Soeren Stark email for faculty page: soeren.stark@nyu.edu

Also, I just noticed a typo in the first event listing, the AIA lecture is missing a 't' in Institute

Thanks,

Kate
