Hey Chris,

The keyboard for one of the macs on the 4th floor (the one in the set of carrels directly next to scanner1 and scanner2), is reportedly not working. People have been coming by to use it, and have mentioned that some of the keys are dead. I thought I'd let you know. Hope work is treating you alright!
