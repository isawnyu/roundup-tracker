It is not an issue and will continue to happen. It's simply a timeout of the Sun Java SSO module if you stay logged in via home.nyu.edu or on that page. We could probably ask ITS to make it longer if it is somehow affecting you but then that will affect all of NYU.

If you are just randomly receiving it or it is just popping up, please reopen this ticket.
