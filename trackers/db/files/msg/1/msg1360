Dear Mike,

On November 11 the exhibition department is hosting a curatorial dialogue followed by a reception. The dialogue will be in the galleries 6-7 PM and the reception will be in the Oak Library 7-8 PM. No furniture needs to be removed from the Oak Library.


**Please excuse the duplicate email. I indicated the date to this event in the subject line of the original request unaware the subject line is not displayed in the email message you receive.**

Thank you,
