Spoke with Mehrnoush and Martin about data jack/registration issue. Data jacks should be active but a kgw MacBook connected to the data jack has a self assigned IP in the carrel. On the phone with ITS about confirming the MAC addresses have been added and whether or not the location is tied to the MAC address.
