<p>With our different and disparate systems and such that need to send notifications and email it's becoming a hassle with using different netids. ISAW the building itself needs a netid unless we setup our own SMTP gateway on automaton.isaw.nyu.edu. I'm a little reluctant to do this because we don't have enough ports and I'm pretty sure we won't be able to get port redundancy. Bridging and bonding aren't allowed so it's the only other rational way to go.</p>
<p>This is an emergency but deferred until I get sometime to deal with trying this out. It's likely downtown will scoff at a building receiving a netid. There is probably some form of regulation that states a netid only gets assigned to a human being or something along those lines. We'll see,&nbsp;</p>
