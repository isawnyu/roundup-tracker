<p>Thanks for your patience with this. If you run into the problem, please try clearing the cache and restarting your browser (computer restart probably won't be necessary) if you run into the problem again. Note that elsewhere on the site it might still be necessary for us to set permissions for you if you've never edited there before.</p>
<p>I suggest we leave this ticket open until Christopher has returned so that he can look into whether there's a caching issue or something else on the server side that might be contributing to your difficulties here. To that end, I'm marking status on this ticket as "testing."</p>
<p>Sound ok?</p>
