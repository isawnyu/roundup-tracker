Mike/Duane:

There was something that Jessica may have neglected to mention yesterday.
There was no trash bag in the waste basket in the Oak library -- and unfortunately, folks have been throwing their trash in it any way. Could we just make sure there are trash bags in that wastebasket every day b/c they just seem to be throwing out garbage without actually paying attention to where they are throwing it. I guess this is better than when they were leaving their trash on the table or floor...
