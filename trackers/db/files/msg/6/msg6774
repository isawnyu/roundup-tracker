<p>I talked to Stephanie Chelalis today in ITS. They don't normally install data lines without turning them on. There indeed is a monthly charge per line, once they are installed and activated.</p>
<p>I talked later to Vito, the FO for ITS. I confirmed that the price that's been provided, $3912, is the installation price only, and includes an activation fee per line. ITS never installs lines without activating them, so they are investigating if they can do this for ISAW.</p>
<p>Also, they are confirming the ISAW cost per data line for our budgetary purposes. He committed to get back to me by 1/23.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They understand our desire to install lines now for anticipated use.</p>
