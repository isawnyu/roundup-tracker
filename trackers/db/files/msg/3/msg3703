After taking a look at Jennifers computer and the Mail client in specific and the way it's storing files it's hard to be sure what happened here. It could just be a minor issue.

I'll follow up with Jennifer to see if she is still receiving the duplicate emails and if so we'll have to spend time walking through and testing with some random email.
