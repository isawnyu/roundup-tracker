<p>We are not ready to add this link yet, but we should take time to determine how hard it would be to add so that when the word to move forward comes (likely in January but possibly before), we can implement quickly.</p>
<p>Where the outside-the-box part of the website template currently has textual links to "jobs" "news" and "login", we'd like to add a fourth textual link (probably to the left of the other 3). It should be one word and will probably either be "donate" or "contribute". It will link to a new page, not yet added, to be hosted at either <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/donate">http://isaw.nyu.edu/donate</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/contribute.">http://isaw.nyu.edu/contribute</a>&nbsp;. Content for that page is currently under discussion prior to development at the cabinet level.&nbsp;</p>
