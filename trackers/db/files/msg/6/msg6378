<p>We simply need a strip of dumb network ports on the North, East and South walls of 605/606. Any basic wall mount patch panel will do, here is a sample one:&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/tzV7uw" target="_blank">http://amzn.to/tzV7uw</a>.&nbsp;This room should have as much ports as we can get especially if it is serving ISAW data. Unfortunately as I'm sure you're already aware, this is the least cost-effective path to be taking and depending on how it is done may require also inclusive switch costs. However, I am very excited to hear about the rationale behind all of this besides what seems to be blind policy so please, strap me in for morning.</p>
