<p>To clarify, there is already an open ticket for overall calendar issues and migration, no. 976. Christopher has added a cross-reference to that ticket, and I will shortly CC you on it so you can follow it. We will leave this ticket open, but in deferred status, until we are in a position to precisely estimate when we can work on it.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, I intend soon to do an export of the shared ical, import to gcal and share it with you, Kate and Whitney so you can test and experiment with it. This will have to happen in precious spare hours around other work and travel (see my update to cabinet, forthcoming). Christopher is still completely busy with start-of-year settling-in tasks and therefore cannot do it; as you'll have seen from his comment, he hopes to address this issue in October. It may require an upgrade to OSX Lion on your machine; that software order was approved today. Due to limits on our resources and the constraints placed on other digital projects team members by grant funding, there is no one else on the digital projects team to whom this work can be given. Hopefully, I will find the time to take that step by sometime early next week, but given the press of other business, I can't promise it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, you are welcome to experiment with exporting your ical calendar and importing it into google docs yourself; however, we cannot provide any support for that effort at present.&nbsp;</p>
