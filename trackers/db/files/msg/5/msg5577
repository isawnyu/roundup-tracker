<p>new feature idea:</p>
<p>when authoring a news item, get options to push a notice and link to the following social media venues: ISAW facebook, ISAW library facebook, ISAW twitter, ISAW linkedin, ISAW academia.edu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe optionally allow tailoring alternate/additional titles, content for each destination context?</p>
