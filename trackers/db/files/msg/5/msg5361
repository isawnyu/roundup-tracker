Hello.

The book scanner in the library is not functioning properly.  When a patron attempts to initiate a scan, a message is displayed that reads: The scanning process was interrupted."  I have shut down the CPU,and turned off the scanner, then restarted, but those actions have not corrected the problem.

Thanks,
Dawn
