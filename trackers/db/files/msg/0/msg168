can I get more details please?

1) how many events need this (I know there are several, not sure if it is needed for all)

2) level of interaction required (is it okay for you three to peak in with audio interaction, or should you each be represented by our own image to the physical group? one to many or many to many?)

3) resources available to remote participants (are these all isights in macbooks, mixed model pc webcams, university resource centers, etc.) - sufficient bandwidth is assumed to exist, but streaming video is high demand and there should be assumed net traffic issues over long periods of time and multiple participants.

4) skype does do video for the record, I've used it before - not sure it meets your needs: http://www.skype.com/allfeatures/videocall/

5) not clear on who is hosting each event - is the event at the MET in their building, or do they take a walk over to ISAW?

6) I know nothing about second life aside from what I read in William Gibson novels in the late 80s.
