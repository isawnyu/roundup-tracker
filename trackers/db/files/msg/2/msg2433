IT coordination for ISAW podium.

Emailed Jason Glenn:


Jason,

I'm the IT Graduate Assistant at ISAW and I will be supporting you as we determine the best configuration for device connectivity in the design of the podium.  Perhaps it would be best if we begin by asking what kind of information would serve you best.  Is a list of components sufficient or would you like us to provide additional details like dimensions etc?

Best regards,
Michael Edgcumbe
