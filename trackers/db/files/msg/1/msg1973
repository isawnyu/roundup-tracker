Roger would like to see a "closed bulletin board space" for senior staff to use on a weekly or more frequent basis. Post more-or-less free-form updates on current work, project status, etc. for viewing by other senior staff members and by the director. Needs a history function (by person I guess) so others can see what's changed over time and mine the thing for annual reports and such.
