Mantha:

This note regards your submission to the ISAW helpdesk on 17 May 2010 (ticket #489048): It is not possible to keep the application &quot;Mail&quot; in dock - I select &quot;keep in dock&quot; and as soon as I quit it disappears. 

Help with Macintosh OSX user problems is outside the scope of assistance that the ISAW IT team can provide for computers other than those purchased and maintained by ISAW for its staff and faculty. This judgment is in accordance with the &quot;Non-ISAW Computers Support Policy&quot; approved by the Director and previously publicized. You can review it here if you no longer have the link sent in previous emails to the ISAW community: http://serv1.isaw.nyu.edu/groups/isaw/wiki/688d0/NonISAW_Computers_Support_Policy.html

Accordingly, I regret that I must close this ticket and direct ISAW IT staff to take no further action in regard to it. You may be able to get assistance with this matter by visiting the store where you purchased the computer or the Apple Store, or by searching in the Macintosh help or online using Google or another search engine. 

Best,
Tom
