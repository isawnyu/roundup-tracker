Kathy has mentioned this to Mike and Dwayne, but I thought there should be a record of it because it is a fairly major issue.  There seems to be some problem in the basement kitchen, possibly electrical, which is causing all the appliances to malfunction at random intervals.  This may be what contributed to Friday's refrigerator meltdown, but it has also at various times caused the freezer to fluctuate wildly in temperature without anyone opening the door, the burners on the stove top to not heat properly, and the ovens to not maintain the proper temperature.  There does not seem to be any particular pattern to what malfunctions at what time. Could we please arrange for someone to look into the problem as soon as possible? Not being able to guarantee a stable temperature, particularly in the freezer and refrigerator, could lead to some food safety issues.
