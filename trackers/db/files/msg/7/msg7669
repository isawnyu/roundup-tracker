<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>Our next exhibition "Echoes of the Past: The Buddhist Cave Temples of Xiangtangshan" opens September 10th. Would you please create a website template for the exhibition with the same pages as the "Nomads and Networks" website. Is it possible to have it completed by the beginning of August?</p>
<p>Let me know if you would like to discuss in person.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Irene</p>
