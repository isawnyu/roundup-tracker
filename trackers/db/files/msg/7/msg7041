<p>The student work computer at 3rd floor reception doesn't seem to be able to connect to the 4th floor printer. We can see 3 different "4th floor printer" options on the pull down menu but when selected, they all say they are not installed.&nbsp; Could we please have that fixed?&nbsp; And also make sure that computer connects to the 4th floor printer in Parallels as well?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
