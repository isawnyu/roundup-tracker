<p>Unfortunately, this part of calendar migration as previously stated.. Your tickets are still in the system and they are related to ticket 976. Again, all of ISAW is affected and not just you. If you'd like to see calendar migration happen sooner, please escalate this ticket with Tom Elliott and or Roger Bagnall who will then provide me with the appropriate resources to see it through as soon as you'd like it done.</p>
<p>I've cc'd them both on this ticket.</p>
