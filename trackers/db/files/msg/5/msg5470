<p>The description field is stripping all of the structure from the actual widget upon display. This is because of the way the description field works. This is a design issue with content types in Plone.<br /><br />Either, I migrate the descriptions to another field and hide the description display or populate the descripton field with whatever the new field will be called or something along those lines.<br /><br />An example of this problem is available for view here: <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/events/quarreling-arguing-negotiating-persuading-and-compromising-rhetorical-strategies-and-techniques-in-late-antique-greek-papyrus-letters/">http://isaw.nyu.edu/events/quarreling-arguing-negotiating-persuading-and-compromising-rhetorical-strategies-and-techniques-in-late-antique-greek-papyrus-letters/</a></p>
