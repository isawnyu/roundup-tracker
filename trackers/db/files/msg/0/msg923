I have had conversations with library staff and others about the climate in the building during the last few weeks.  It has been uncomfortable - hot, humid and stuffy, and worse as the day wears on.  Today it is particularly uncomfortable.

The problem is particularly acute for the majority of staff who work at carrels with task lighting, but it is also a problem for those of us with windows.
