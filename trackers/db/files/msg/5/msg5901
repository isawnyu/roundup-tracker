<p>Chris,</p>
<p>I agree with your last comment, but this was not how I understood the previous comments, so thanks for clarifying. My thoughts are that it is fine if tickets are resolved, to have them time out, but if they are not, they remain in the system until resolved. I'm not sure how the ticketing system will know that something is "resolved" without human intervention, but maybe "mind melds" are on the task list.</p>
<p>Thanks for clarifying, D</p>
