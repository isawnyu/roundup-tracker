<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>I normally use Thunderbird to create exhibition announcements to send to the listserv because it gives me the option to insert pictures and use color. While creating the message I get the following error messages. "There was an error copying the message to the Sent folder. Retry?". Since I did not try to send the message I clicked "cancel" and then received the second error message "Save Draft Error Unable to save your message as draft. Please verify that your Mail &amp; Newsgroups account settings are correct and try again." Please help - I need to send this announcement out on Friday.</p>
<p><br /> Thanks. Irene</p>
