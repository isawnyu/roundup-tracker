<p>This from Whitney on 9/2/11:</p>
<pre>Hi Tom,

Do you know what the status is on the new event request form for the website? We've been having people email me as a stop gap measure but that's really not ideal.  We're getting more and more requests (internally and from other NYU entities) to use the space and it would be easier to point them to the form so we can get all the information we need up front.

Thanks,

Whitney
