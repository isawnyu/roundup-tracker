Received this morning from Diane:


Tom,

George Hatke is a new scholar on-boarding this week. Kate has been working directly with Chris to get him set up in the various ISAW systems. Chris assured Kate before George arrived that everything was set up and he had communicated directly with George.

I have a copy of the email sent to George yesterday that only gives a link to go into the ISAW webpage to set up a  password with very minimal information and no contact info (it is from ISAW Administrator). Since Kate was not copied on the email, it was only when George in utter frustration came to see her this morning, that she learned of this.

Kate also doesn't know what George is doing on this website, so she's unable to provide any support or guidance as to what he should expect. For example, are his copier codes on this website?

Furthermore, George's brand new computer is not working and he is on his way back to the Computer Store to see what's wrong, but he has no wireless or ethernet access information to be functional within ISAW.

Please let Kate know what processes the new person will gain access to through this site and what support your team will provide. If you would prefer to talk about this than respond by email, please communicate directly with Kate as she is on the front lines.

Thanks in advance,
Diane
