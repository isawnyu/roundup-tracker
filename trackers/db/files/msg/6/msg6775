<p>I'm just so utterly confused about the cost associated with this. $600 USD reoccuring per port is such an obscene expletive I can't even think of the right word. I'd like to know if this comes with a real life unicorn? Unofrtunately, if we aren't getting a unicorn for the price as stands. I'd rather send whatever we need to a datacenter because then it would be much much cheaper.</p>
