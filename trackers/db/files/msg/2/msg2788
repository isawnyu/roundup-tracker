Hello Christopher,

We would like to have a generic email account for the library: isaw.library@nyu.edu.  Chuck and I should receive the messages.  Will you let me know if there is any other information you need in order to get the process started?  Also, will we receive notification once the account is active?
Thanks,
Dawn
