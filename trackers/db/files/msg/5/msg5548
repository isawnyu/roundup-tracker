<p>rcvd 8/1911: action deferred because of high-priority work for Roger</p>

<p>Dear Tom,</p>
<div>The server 'agade' is the most important source of information in ancient Near Eastern Studies, and for some reason I repeatedly get this message as shown below since about 8 days or so, even if I send the message 'unhold' back to them. I have written already to Chris but did not get any reply, perhaps he is on vacation? Since August 15th I also suddenly cannot receive messages on my Blackberry again, after I had solved the problem with downtown about two months ago, which is really unfortunate, since I am in Europe and do not always have internet connection. As the semester is approaching rapidly, I would be most grateful to learn how the problems can be solved as soon as possible.</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for your help,</div>
<div>Beate</div>
