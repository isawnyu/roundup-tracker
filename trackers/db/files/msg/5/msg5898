<p>Chris,</p>
<p>I was afraid of that. Closing the ticket automatically after a pre-determined time is not preferred by Roger or me, unless something has changed (and I'd appreciate knowing if that's the case). Things that are low priority, especially in busy time periods, are still important and should not disappear just because they are dated. They should remain in the system until completed, unless you are suggesting another way to track or maintain their visibility.</p>
<p>An example of an old but valid ticket would be Roger's table, which isn't fixed after months in the ticketing system (and several conversations before that), and has now been put into another work queue, but will (sadly) probably not be resolved for another 6 mos. Removing this from the building tickets does not resolve this important request. Open building tickets are reviewed monthly at the building meeting.</p>
<p>The large number of building tickets in Sept was due to Mike's technical inability to close them, even though the work was continuing. In my opinion, it is in ISAW's best interest to have the action of closing them upon completion continue.</p>
