Hi Micheal,

I think our connection should have some problem. Because most of the times internet is so slow for such an institute. It usually takes relatively long time for opening normal pages, especially I have often problems with sending emails. Sometimes it is OK, but many times I can not reach gmail or it takes some minutes before I can send even a short text message. I also checked the wired connection, because I thought it should be stronger than wireless connection, but it is the same. I talked to Zoe and she has the same problem.

Thank you
