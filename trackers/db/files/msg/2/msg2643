ISAW will need to purchase a new printer/copier for the sixth floor. We have been asked to provide 2 or 3 options that are compatible with the network and infrastructure we have now. Here are the requirements:

* Roger wants something mainly for convenience, probably not much more than $400-500 in cost
* as a minimum, it should function as both a printer and copier
* exhibitions would dearly love it if it was also a scanner

Could you find us 2 or 3 options in this range and email them to me, Diane and Irene?

Thanks,
Tom
