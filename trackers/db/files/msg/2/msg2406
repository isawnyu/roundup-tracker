Kathy (our new chef) has asked if it would be possible to get some kind of hutch or cabinet to put in the dining room for storage of clean tableware, thus leaving the kitchen cabinets open for the cooking dishes.  It seems like one of the easiest solutions to this would be to replace the folding table we currently set out for collecting dirty dishes with a counter-height cabinet, which would not increase the footprint of the furniture already in the room.  

If this is something that we can pursue further, the next question would be whether I should research pre-made options or if it would be preferable to have something custom made. This is obviously not an urgent problem, as we can make do for now, but it is an issue that needs some consideration.

Thanks,
Whitney
