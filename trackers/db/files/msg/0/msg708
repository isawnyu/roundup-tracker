Dear Tim,
I noticed earlier that I can not log into the wireless here with my nyu id and password. Here this is no problem, since there is cable anyway, but yesterday at Bobst I would have loved to be able to connect wirelessly. Could you please check if I am registered for its usage.
Thanks, Christian
