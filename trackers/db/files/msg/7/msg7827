<p>The problem here isn't the printer, something is going on with the Windows installation such that the registry settings have been changed, most likely by the recent Trojan. This will involve some work to find out exactly where and what was changed as there are no default settings to just return to in a Windows system. Also because this machine wasn't being readily backed up to anywhere there is nothing to return to. What may need to occur is a full wipe of Mike's machine and a full reinstall. Of course, when that can actually occur is the question. We'll have to figure something out.</p>
