<p>Mike,</p>
<p>On Thursday April 5th we are co-hosting a reception with the Consul General of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The reception will be in the Oak Library, 6-8pm. We expect over 130 people, therefore all the furniture needs to be removed from the Oak Library, except for the two tables and the two large couches, which should be moved against the walls. Also we need the podium from the lecture hall moved into the Oak Library.</p>
<p>As always I am happy to discuss in person.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Irene</p>
