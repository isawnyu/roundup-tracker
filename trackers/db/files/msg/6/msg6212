<p>Diane,</p>
<p>Mike and I discussed this one as well.&nbsp; I think it is pretty standard in offices that whomever is using the shredder when it gets full should dump the contents into the recycling garbage.&nbsp; That way it is available for the next person - common courtesy.&nbsp; Duane, of course, is responsible for emptying the garbage on a daily basis.&nbsp; That is the way it works in every office I have worked in.&nbsp; Do you think this is too much burden for your staff???</p>
