Tim I have successfully installed the ArcView. When I try to run components, I'm told it's unregistered and taken to the "registration wizard" which gives me the following options: "I have installed ArcView and need to register the sofware" or "I have received an authorization file from ESRI and am now ready to finish the registration process". 

How should I proceed?
