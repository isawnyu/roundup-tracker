<p><strong>Estimated Grind Time</strong></p>
<p>Time wise we are looking at about a week minimum as the 3 iMacs will have to be fully broken down, new hardware installed, drives zero'd out, operating system reinstalled etc, then all of the data migrated from time machine backups for each machine that is swapped out etc. Not to mention trying to do this in a manner that keeps people working.<br /><br />The rotation will be to rehaul the three (3) mid 2007 iMacs and verify their fitness before working with the other machines. At which point we'll do a swap out where necessary which will allow for everyone to keep working. With the exception of Irene who will just be swapped out when the upgraded memory for the 24inch iMac is received.</p>
