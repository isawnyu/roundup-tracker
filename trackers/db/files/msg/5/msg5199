Per Diane, Beate's having similar problems this morning (ticket 446507). Since Christopher is traveling today, I've recommended Diane contact ITS directly and give them the details about both problems. This is likely to be something that ITS has to resolve as it may well arise from the switch upgrade over the weekend (in any case, there's very little the ISAW IT can do about connectivity problems as all of that is in ITS's hands).
