Roger would like to see a means, on the website, for people to sign up for lunches, indicate how many guests will be with them and so forth. They should be able to sign up for arbitrary periods of time, ranging from single days to weeks at a time. I'm thinking that this need could be met by a more generic system, something that would also support signups for other events (e.g., RSVP for big lectures).
