Jonathan,

In this case, the manufacturer of your computer would be your only recourse to investigate this issue.  If you have a Macintosh, I suggest that you make an appointment with the Genius Bar at the Apple Store.  If you have a PC, please refer to your specific customer support policy.

With regard,
Michael
