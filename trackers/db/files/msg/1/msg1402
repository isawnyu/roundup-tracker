Dear Michael,

The exhibitions department is hosting a lecture in the Lecture Hall on Thursday December 3, 6-7 PM. I can set up the projector and screen myself, however I am unsure about using the microphone. I understand that you are not normally here on Thursdays so next week, when you are here, could you please show me how to set up the microphone?

Thanks,
Irene
