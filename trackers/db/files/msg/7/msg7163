<p>Hi Chris,<br />My apologies for writing to you directly, I did not remember how to proceed in the help desk anymore. I just wanted to ask you whether you have already taken any initiative regarding a new air book for me. Also, when I try to install an additional program on my air book and it is asking me for my password, it still does not accept my current password.<br />Beate</p>
