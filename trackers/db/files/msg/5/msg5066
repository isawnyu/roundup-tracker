On a personal profile for which a CV has been added, there's a formatting problem. See mine: http://isaw.nyu.edu/people/staff/tom-elliott

The &quot;View full CV&quot; header only fills half the content space and part of the recent publications content scrolls up strangely.

Roger wants me to get the faculty started adding their CVs with the goal of having that work done by the time school starts in the fall, so we're going to need to fix this in the next couple of weeks.
