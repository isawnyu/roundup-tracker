<p>I'm not personally working on this machine. The appointment for this repair is with the Apple store on the Upper West Side at 11am the morning of April 9th. Obviously i'll retain a car to have this delivered and repaired. In the meantime we'll restore your account to a different machine so you can continue your work. When the machine has been repaired by Apple then we'll restore your account again to the repaired machine.</p>
<p>I have no control over the repair time.</p>
