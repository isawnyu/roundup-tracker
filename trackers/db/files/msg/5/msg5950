<p>If you select "Add new" it should allow you to add files as well, there is a 1GB limit on files. If you need something bigger than that we will need to talk about placement otherwise you can publish this content yourself. The idea is that a peer should review your content before your post but I realize this concept may need some tweaking. Just select the "Pending review" state and select "Publish externally".. The urls are the same and everyone in China should be able to access this page. If not, please let me know the province.</p>
<p>Also the urls will probably change in the future because the alexander.jones-40nyu.edu part of it is going to cause problems; but it will automatically redirect so you'll have nothing to do on your end.</p>
