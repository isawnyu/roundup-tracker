<p>Dear Tom and Chris (ISAW IT Team),</p>
<p>We have not received any updates to Tom's below email message from yesterday evening. Could you please provide the <br />requested information (the MAC address of the router's WAN port and the datajack # it will be connected to)? Since <br />we do not have this information, we are unable to finalize the activation of the vDMZ subnet/vlan on which the <br />vendor's equipment at ISAW, 15 E 8th Street will reside. Once we have it in hand, we should be able to proceed to <br />the activation fairly rapidly, assuming no physical intervention is required. That said, since we did not receive <br />the information, the network may not be available for start of business on Monday (as per our conversation, this <br />network connectivity is for remote admin access only; the operation of the exhibit itself is not dependent on this <br />connectivity).</p>
<p>As far as the IP address assignment for the WAN port on the vendor's router, we have completed the allocation. The <br />IP address on the new subnet which has been allocated for this purpose (192.76.177.248/29):</p>
<p>DEVICE FQDN: ISAW-VENDOR-RTR.NYU.ORG<br />DEVICE USER NETID: cww6<br />DEVICE RESPONSIBLE PARTY NETID: te20<br />DEVICE IP ADDRESS: 192.76.177.253<br />SUBNET MASK: 255.255.255.248<br />DEFAULT GATEWAY: 192.76.177.249</p>
<p>Please use the above IP, Netmask, and Default Gateway values to configure the settings for the router's WAN port.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Yoni</p>

Here's the follow-up email I promised. I've <br />&gt; copied Christopher Warner, who will be taking over from me on this issue <br />&gt; since I'll be traveling tomorrow. Larry Smallwood is the <br />&gt; vendor/installer; he's presently traveling back home from NYC. Alexander <br />&gt; Noelle is coordinating matters for ISAW's exhibitions team.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Please copy isaw.it@nyu.edu on any and all replies.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Here's where I understand we're going to try to go:<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Getting the router hooked up and approved under the logical rubric of <br />&gt; the "virtual DMZ service" with a public-facing IP address. I understand <br />&gt; that Yoni is working to problem to find an available IP address in this <br />&gt; space.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Christopher has the admin password etc. for the control machine on the <br />&gt; display LAN, and therefore administrative access to the router as <br />&gt; necessary.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Christopher, can you provide Yoni with:<br />&gt; <br />&gt; * the router's MAC address<br />&gt; * the number of the data jack to which it is to be connected<br />&gt; <br />&gt; I checked with the exhibitions team, and the press opening is Monday <br />&gt; morning.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Many thanks to everybody for pitching in on this!<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Best,<br />&gt; Tom<br />&gt; <br />&gt;</p>
