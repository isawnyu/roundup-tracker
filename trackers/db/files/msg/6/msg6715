<p>I am just back from a meeting and I am getting warning "Address Book can't verify the identity of the server "serv1.isaw.nyu.edu". I cannot Cancel or Continue - goes into endless loop.</p>
<p>Functionality seems to be fine, other than the fact I can't make the Verify Certificate warning disappear.</p>
