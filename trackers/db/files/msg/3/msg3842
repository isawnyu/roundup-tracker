For off-the-cuff commentary. NYU-NET policy needs to be updated here. I'm not sure of all the details of the network and i'm sure it's globally reaching. However, this is standard procedure for many companies and seems to be more of an IP management issue. Hopefully and surely NYU as an institution can figure out how to simply manage registering two ip's to one nic and limiting the max bandwidth or managing it via the switch for burstability.
