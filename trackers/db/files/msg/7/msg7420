<p>Yeah, I think we&rsquo;re not engaging in any large-scale solution. To add complexity (or just more options) it looks like there are a few new options in the market:</p>
<p>1. LogMeIn is launching a new cloud storage/sharing service. It has some unique aspects, like selecting your own folders to share, instead of just sharing folders in your &ldquo;Dropbox&rdquo; or &ldquo;Box&rdquo; folders. Also, it has the (as of now) unique capability of sharing files between your computers without storing in your online account. So, for example, if you didn&rsquo;t want to back up your 50GB of iTunes music to a Dropbox account, with LogMeIn, you could use the service to sync those folders between your computers without eating up your account storage.</p>
<p>2. Google Drive. Yep, they have another iteration. Supposed to launch next week.</p>
<p>Anyway, good luck with your plans, and please let me know if you decide to jump in one camp or another.</p>
