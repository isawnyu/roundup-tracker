<p>My version of excel in Parralels has failed product activation. I can't seem to access Hyperion Planning which is a budget system I need for a training that I will be attending tomorrow. Please assist. It may be also that the verion of excel on my machine is too much for the NYU suggested version which is 2007. Either way I need help asap...</p>
