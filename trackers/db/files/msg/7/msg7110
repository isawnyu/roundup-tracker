<p>I'm going to consider this a bug as default views should get the same access settings as their view containers. What was happening here is that the containers were created and a default page object created with only manager access in mind. &nbsp;Stupidly, I forgot about this and would modify the container settings neglecting the actual default view container page object, which was the default view for the container. Inheritance didn't work because editors obviously don't have manage portal content access by default. So, everything else would be editable except the actual default view container making it seem as if there was no edit access.</p>
<p>My opinion is that this is a dumb way to operate. The default view container if it's a page object should at the very least should get the same access settings as the default container for that view, because that makes sense. I don't have the stamina to bring this up on the plone list right now. Switching priority to low and leaving open to keep myself reminded that someday I should.</p>
