<p>Google calendar supports resource calendars (i.e. rooms) just like meeting maker did (but ical does not). I've just written to ITS requesting information on who the currently identified "resource manager" is (that's the person who will have permissions to modify the calendar and extend those permissions to others). I'll post follow up here. Tom P.S. I'm taking ownership of this ticket for the moment.</p>
