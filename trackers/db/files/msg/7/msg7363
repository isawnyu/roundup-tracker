<p>Hi Tom,<br />I was able to download AutoCAD, but at the time of the installation, a<br />screen shows up asking me for product information. I have more than<br />one choice:<br />If I click on "Stand-Alone", I am asked for the serial number and the<br />product key (or I can choose to try the product for 30 days). If I<br />click on "Network", It asks to select the license server (single,<br />distributed, or redundant) but for any of these I am supposed to enter<br />additional information on the server, which I don't have.<br />Do you know what I could do at this point?<br />Many thanks,<br />Nicola</p>
