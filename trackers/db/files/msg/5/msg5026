Now that I have almost survived my move to an iMac at home and the transition in email, I am looking ahead to two further changes this summer.

(1) Bringing my ISAW Macbook Air into line with my home machine, i.e. having the Mac side be dominant and the Windows apps in a Parallels window.
(2) Moving from my Blackberry (now a 4-year-old model) to a new smartphone. I'm thinking Android, but willing to discuss. Carrier is difficult, because T-Mobile is (a) dead at ISAW and (b) perhaps soon to be swallowed by AT&T, but Verizon is not GSM compatible (essential) and AT&T isn't exactly everyone's favorite network.

I'd like to launch the first of these after I get back form my coming trip (4-11 June), the second sometime before the end of the summer.
