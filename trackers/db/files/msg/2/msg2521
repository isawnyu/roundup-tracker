After discussing this situation with our new Associate Director (Diane), and having her look at the situation in the kitchen, she's asked that someone please check the voltage in the kitchen as soon as possible, preferably in the next 24 hours.  A voltage meter should be able to diagnose whether or not there is a problem with the system in the kitchen.  She is very concerned about the possibility for food contamination due to the inability to have consistent refrigeration in the kitchen.
