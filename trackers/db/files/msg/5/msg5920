<p>This is in reply to Peter's email (copied below) which he sent to both Diane and myself in lieu of a ticket.&nbsp; It appears the roof in the large conference room is still leaking.&nbsp; By the time I was notified, the rain had lessened quite a bit and the puddle in the table was cleaned up, so there were only a couple of drops on the table.&nbsp; I could not see any active drips, but the location of the drops on the table made me think the leak might not be from the window but the holes where the light fixtures are attached.&nbsp; There was no permanent water damage and I set the wastebaskets up where the drips were to catch any additional water.</p>
