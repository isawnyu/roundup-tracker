Hi Chris,

How come the times on these messages are so out of whack?  It is 2:11 pm by my computer now.   I am sending a second reply because I'm going to need to keep that file on the computer for a couple of weeks.   The format I saved them in wasn't compatible either with my PC.  In the short term, I've fixed for the purposes of Thursday by resaving through a round-about way, but I will want to resave on the ISAW computer in a different format to keep as much information as possible from the scanned original, as it were.  But I will be busy this week and away next week, so it won't be for a bit that I will be able to get back to it.

thanks again.
Karen
