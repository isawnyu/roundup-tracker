I'm having problems with certain email addresses for recipients of the Ancient-Medieval-Astronomy listserv I administer through the NYU Lyris system. Addresses that should be problem-free (e.g. a colleague at Brown with address @brown.edu and another at Caltech @caltech.edu) are persistently getting permanent failures explained as "Completed: The domain is reported to be bad via DNS." I've checked for mistyping, but the addresses are absolutely correct as entered on the system. Is there someone who can help with this?
