Michael:

I've had a question from John Bernstein that I thought you might know the answer to: who is the commercial provider that provides our data connectivity at 15E84? I assume we're "on" the NYU network, but that the cable and transport is being provided commercially under contract.

Thanks for any help you can provide.

Tom
