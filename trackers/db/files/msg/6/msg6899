<p>The instructions for reoccuring are here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/life/resources-and-services/nyu-google-migration/learn-by-app/calendar.html">http://www.nyu.edu/life/resources-and-services/nyu-google-migration/learn-by-app/calendar.html</a></p>
<p>To my knowledge there is no known bug with Google Calendar in regards to it not obeying reoccuring events. However, please contact ITS because I can't do anything with Google Calendar. At least not in regards to NYU/ISAW. If this is indeed a bug, they'll know about it, but just to set your expectation it is highly unlikely. If it's still a problem let me know.</p>
