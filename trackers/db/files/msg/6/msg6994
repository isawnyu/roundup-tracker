<p>Hi Diane:</p>
<p>We are interested in finding out what it would cost to get a Cisco "soft phone" for Sebastian and another for me (like what Elizabeth has). Is it clear to you from the resolution of the telecommunications overheads questions what the answer to that would be, or do we need to run it down with telecom?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p>
