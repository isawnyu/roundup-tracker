<p>Mehrnoush,</p>
<p>We are experiencing problems with our wifi network currently and there are several open tickets in trying to get this remedied. As for your ticket system login it's "ms5600@nyu.edu" and your password. If you've lost your password you can click this link:&nbsp;<a href="http://ticket.isaw.nyu.edu/help/user?@template=forgotten">Lost your password?</a>&nbsp;and reset it. I realize remembering all your passwords that you need can be a burden.</p>
<p>Single sign-on will reach us someday, in the interm I suggest <a href="http://www.lastpass.com">http://www.lastpass.com</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://1password.com">http://1password.com</a>&nbsp;</p>
