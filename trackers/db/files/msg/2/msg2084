I had made a request that the library doors on 3, 4, and 5 be locked at times when the building has no guard.

We have noticed that all three doors are now locked shortly after 5 PM, and remain locked until some time between 8 and 9 AM, and that none of the library staff has swipe-card access.

It would be better to have the doors locked on the schedule I requested (i.e. the same schedule at the front door), and that all members of the Library staff have swipe card access privilege to these three doors

Thanks,
