<p>Monolith Modular will be here on Thursday at 10am to fix this. Unfortunately that is after Roger wants to give his ULT practice run, so we'll need to set up the portable projector for Wednesday. Chris, do you know if we have one of those computer/projector connector cables that is longer than the ones in the bag?</p>
