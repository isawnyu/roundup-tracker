<p>Hi Stephanie:</p>
<p>We've got a need to add more network ports (physical jacks with lines <br />back to the switch) in a room at 15 E 84th. We have to staff options <br />against costs and get approval before providing chartfield, ok-ing work, <br />etc. What's the right way to go about requesting cost estimate <br />information for something like this?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Tom</p>
