Diane:

I have incorporated this language on the events listing, the prior events listing and each individual listing. You can see examples on the preview site here:

http://pipsqueak.atlantides.org/isaw/events.htm
http://pipsqueak.atlantides.org/isaw/events/dalfonso-2011-01-14.htm
http://pipsqueak.atlantides.org/isaw/events_old.htm

Once Kate has approved the implementation of the latest updates to event content reflected here, I'll push all of this to the public site. Let me know if you spot anything amiss.

I'm now going to make the appropriate modification to the &quot;Before Pythagoras&quot; website, and publish that.

Once both sets of site updates are published, I'll close this ticket unless I hear from you meantime that there's a problem.

Thanks,
Tom
