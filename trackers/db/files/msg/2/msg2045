Lillian Tseng specializes in ancient Chinese art and archaeology. Prior to joining ISAW in 2010, she served as Associate Professor in the Department of the History of Art at Yale University. Tseng received her B.A. and M.A. in History from National Taiwan University (1988, 1992), and her Ph.D. in History of Art and Architecture from Harvard University (2001). She was awarded a post-doctoral fellowship from the Getty Foundation, a Morse Junior Faculty Fellowship from Yale, and two fellowships from the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange.

Tseng is interested in exploring the interface of art history and cultural history. She is the author of Picturing Heaven in Early China (Harvard University Press, 2011). She has also published a number of articles concerned with diverse cultural issues in Chinese art, such as history and memory, visual replication and political persuasion, pictorial representation and historical writing, and the interchangeability of the self and the other. Tseng is currently at work two book projects: one investigates the reception of antiquity and its impact on visual production in eighteenth-century China, while the other examines frontiers and visual imaginations in Han China. She is also editing a scholarly volume entitled Representing Things: Visuality and Materiality in East Asia.
