Safe to ignore. I just spoke with Kate again, the other popup issue hasn't returned. Closing.

TECH NOTE:
Backup delayed pop-up not such a big deal but it will begin to become more of a problem over time as more faculty/staff begin to backup over a 100Mbps link. It'll eventually become saturated and begin causing other server related issues.
