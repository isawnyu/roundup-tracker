<p>Diane's Mac has been restored, there were some problems with this involving Applications that were installed from long ago that were admin mode only so they weren't backed up and restored, for instance Iphoto. I'll need to find the 2009 version for that as that is the only version that will install. Also probably needs to have some odds and ends from the virtual machine put in place but we'll see from there.</p>
