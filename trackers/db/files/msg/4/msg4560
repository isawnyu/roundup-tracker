Peter:

We cannot legally install university-licensed software on personally owned computers, therefore unfortunately we won't be able to install FMPro on your laptop. We do, however, have a copy of Adobe CS4 that we can use to install Photoshop on the exhibitions machine. Christopher will coordinate with you to find a time to do this before you leave.

Best,
Tom
