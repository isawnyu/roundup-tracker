Reopening this.. The laptop is here unfortunately there were issues down at the Apple Store..  When I arrived it was stated that the apple laptop was ready.. Unfortunately the solution to the problem was a reinstall, which I stated we had already done with on-going issue.  I also questioned the whole idea of waiting for multiple parts if it was just a simple OS reinstall.

At that point to remedy my confusion I spoke with Jackie who informed me that it's a simple mayhem problem. A hard drive was installed right there on the spot and I told her as that was complete we'd take the laptop back from them. She then called Shareen Powlett who researched the issue and offered to remedy the solution with a iTunes gift card. 

I told her that would be quite useless and that the complaint was all I needed at this point. The next steps are to reinstall the laptop from Chucks image and then take it to another Apple store to verify it's in completely working order.
