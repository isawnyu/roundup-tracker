<p>I have rebooted and when it came up, 3 Safari windows did not complete the process. Then got a system message to power down &amp; restart (soft boot). Had this happen 3 times. The last time, the apps started to open and I tried to close the Finder as other apps and it went into spiral of death again.... Hit the power button and letting it sleep....</p>
