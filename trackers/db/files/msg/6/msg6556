<p>Well, i'm not sure I said dpi has nothing to do with resolution. I am however quite sure I stated that lowering DPI will not lower resolution. So for instance going from 600 DPI to 200 DPI doesn't mean resolution has changed in any manner. What it does mean is that you'll get a lower quality image at the same resolution. Resolution has nothing to do with DPI except as being the canvas for which the dots per inch fit in.</p>
<p>So you have a blank piece of 8.5x11 paper (RESOLUTION).<br />You switch from 600 dots-per-inch to 200 dots-per-inch (DPI).</p>
<p>Does the size of the blank piece of paper change? No, because it's the same piece of paper, you are just putting 200 dots per inch on it instead of 600. If the piece of paper changed sizes that would be highly against the laws of physics and very unusual and as such considered ridiculous. However, I am not a physicist.</p>
<p>The scanner defaults to NORMAL resolution which is probably much more than required. This most likely happened after an update or some such and can be set to WEB or SMALL resolution which will again, reduce the file size. If for some reason after you've tried switching the resolution to WEB (smaller file size) and you receive a large file then we'll have to escalate but I recommend trying to switch the resolution first.</p>
