<p>When talking with Karen about using the website to set up a community, I tried to move the state of a page in my folder from internal to published. The site indicated that the page had been submitted for review. Is that correct? If it is, that's OK. But the delay in visibility makes the website less useful as a tool for sharing research and/or creating communities. As in, it's hard to be agile when that lag is built in. So I raise the issue here for discussion.</p>
