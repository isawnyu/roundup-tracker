Tim:

I'd like to add a skype capability, on the macbook already requested, as well as the polycom skype-o-phone gear. Sean is going to join us remotely. This is needed only for the workshop, not for the evening lectures (which are on a separate ticket).

Please let me know if that presents a difficulty.

Thanks,
Tom
