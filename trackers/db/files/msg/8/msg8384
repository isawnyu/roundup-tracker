<p><span>Via Jessica "The scanner is acting up today: After it sits a while unused and then someone tries to scan something, the book image is not full (too much black scanner bed shows behind a smaller opened book). If we turn the scanner off and back on again, it scans as it should, first try, full screen. Then... it goes wrong again after it sits a while."</span></p>
