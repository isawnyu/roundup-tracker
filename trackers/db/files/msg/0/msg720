Hi Mike and Duane:

I just wanted to let you know that Shelby mentioned that a light in the seminar room chandelier was out. You might be waiting for bulbs to arrive or something, but I'm just worried that she might notice again at next Tuesday's VRS luncheon -- in which case she might ask why it hasn't been fixed yet.

Best,
Suzan
