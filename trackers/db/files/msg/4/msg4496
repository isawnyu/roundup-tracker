We have a working machine here that looks somewhere close to actual production value. We are going to leave it to settle over the night to make sure there are no issues and get the machine to Kate first thing in the morning.

Kate is back with a report that it's a logic board replacement which is necessary and Apple will be upgrading it for free of charge which is good news. We are looking at a first round estimate of 5-7 days. That aside, Kate should probably be bumped in the queue if she isn't already for a replacement laptop in the coming months.
