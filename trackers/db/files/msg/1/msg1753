This was sent Jan 11. If I don't see it by the end of this week i'll have to visit the actual office of of web communications and watch them do it.

Hey Christopher,
The Centers and Institutes page data is generated via a specific component
of the NYU.edu site.  It takes some time to update the content and we try to
do it in batches. We have one coming up soon (end of this week or early next
week), and I'll let you know when this has been added.

Thanks!

Tim
