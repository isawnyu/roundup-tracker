<p>My reply to Whitney on 9/2:</p>
<p>Whitney: <br /> <br />We've got an open ticket on this issue: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="issue1290">http://ticket.isaw.nyu.edu/help/issue1290</a> <br /> <br />I've just added you and Diane as "cc" on it; Kate was already tracking the ticket. If you read through the comments etc. (which I recommend) you'll see that we have the first pass of the form on the site, but disabled, pending our ability to make the changes Diane requested earlier in the year. This work has been deferred up to this point because of other priorities. <br /> <br />The question that you, Diane and Kate will want to sort out is whether you want the modifications made and tested before turning the form on, or whether you'd be happy to have the existing form turned on in its current condition until we have time to work on the modifications. <br /> <br />Let us know which way you'd like to proceed (preferably by appending a comment to this ticket) and then we'll put that into the list of things to be prioritized by the cabinet going forward, once the new user rush is sorted out. <br /> <br />Thanks, <br />Tom&nbsp;</p>
