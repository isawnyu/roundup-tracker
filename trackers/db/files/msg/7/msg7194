<p>Mike,</p>
<p>Next Monday, April 9th and Thursday April 12th the exhibitions department is hosting two events.</p>
<p>Monday we are co-hosting a reception with the Permanent Mission of Kazakhstan, 6-8 pm, in the Oak Library. We expect 40-50 people. Therefore the furniture should remain in its usual placement.</p>
<p>Thursday we are co-hosting a lecture/reception with the American Friends of the Louvre. The lecture in the Lecture Hall from 6pm to 7pm will be followed by a reception in the Oak Library until 8pm. The furniture in the Oak Library should remain it its usual placement and the Lecture Hall should have 85 chairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As always I am happy to discuss in person.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
