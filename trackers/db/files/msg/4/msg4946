This follows up on a brief convo w/Chris.

1: The "Current Exhibit" block on the front page is not a live link to the exhibition page. (Related: sometime we use "exhibit", sometimes "exhibition(s)".)

2: The RSS feed is titled only "News". That makes them a little buried in my Google reader. Perhaps "ISAW News" or "News from the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World".
