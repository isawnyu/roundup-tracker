<p>As an update, I think this is a good idea, unfortunately it's not something that I can employ at ISAW. It's simply a gross time sink and I don't have any. So one edits their pdf and I'd have to parse all of that information back into Plone in structured fashion. It's not a low hit item for me and I really don't get much time to actually do any programming or anything serious at ISAW. Probably not the best idea to have me working on this. It would take time, testing, etc. That aside,&nbsp;I'm sure someone in the Plone community would pick this up and would definitely contribute to see this completed!</p>
