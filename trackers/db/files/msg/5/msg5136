Chris, I've got the Macbook Air in my office. After looking things over, I realize that the programs for which I use Parallels at home are not relevant for the laptop, so I think the simplest thing is to reconfigure this for pure Mac operation with no Windows at all. The software I need on it is Office, Filemaker Pro, Acrobat, Firefox, Thunderbird, Filezilla, and the VPN. Anything else I'll install myself.
