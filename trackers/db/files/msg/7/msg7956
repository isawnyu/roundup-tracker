<p>The exhibition galleries seem to be currently set at about 60 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 10 degrees below the required temperature of 70 degrees (plus/minus two degrees) Fahrenheit. &nbsp;Please reset the temperature for the galleries to 70 degrees as soon as possible, as the objects have been installed and we must maintain a temperature of 70 degress (plus/minus two degrees) according to the contract.</p>
