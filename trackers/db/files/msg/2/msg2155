We will wait till Monday September 27, 2010 to ensure that there is nothing wrong with this laptop before having AppleCare transferred/restored. 

I don't think we'll have it transferred as we'll lose 3 months on the laptop. Considering this has caused no small amount of pain for ISAW as an institution and considering the turn around took so long it is best that we have it cancelled and refunded. Getting a new AppleCare agreement for this laptop would be best.
