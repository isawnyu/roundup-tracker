<p>The netid has existed for several years, so I'm not sure what you're referring to.</p>
<p>He will be in the office on Tuesday afternoon and I will help him activate his email, etc. He has asked for IT support at that time.</p>
<p>Since I cannot print his setup information for him, I unable to facilitate his setup. Please communicate directly with him on james.watt@metmuseum.org.</p>
