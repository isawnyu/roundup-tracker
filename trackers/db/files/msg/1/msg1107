Martin,

It may be possible to connect your Blackberry to the wireless.  I know that I am always connected through my iPhone using the NetID that I have on the NYU network.  If you'd like, we can take a look at it together.

Also, if you would prefer a hard line to the network, you are correct that we must register your MAC with the university.  Please don't worry about the cables, I have plenty in room 509.  I would suggest that it's a good idea to plug in if you have concerns about moving a lot of data quickly or securely, but for day to day use, the wireless may suit your needs.  Please let me know which you would feel morecomfortable with.

Best,
Michael
