<p>I returned to work this morning with my computer in setup mode. My Mail client is not set up, my bookmarks are wiped out, my application shortcuts are wiped out, etc. The system is asking questions that I have no idea what the right answers are and I have to get to work. I came in early to recover from being on vacation and have spent the last half hour getting to the point I can write this email.</p>
<p>If there were things I was supposed to do this morning to either return to funcitonality or not touch the machine, why was a note not left on my desk? Sending me an email through a system I can't access without my machine is ridiculous! I need this machine either restored to operation or replaced with a temporary ASAP.</p>
