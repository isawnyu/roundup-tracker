<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>Diane thought this might be important to note as ITS checks the phone system.&nbsp; It appears the fax machine is no longer recognizing the "#" button as a pause (which is necessary when you are entering a long distance fax and need to put in the code afterward).&nbsp; There is another designated pause button on the machine that we can use in the meantime, but the # button used to work, and as far as I can remember, did work up until the switch over.&nbsp; So I don't know if it means anything at all but I thought I'd mention it.</p>
