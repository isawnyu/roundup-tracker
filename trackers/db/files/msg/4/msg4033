Beate still had an unbalanced error but it was due to an incorrect entry in her addressbook. We updated that and tried again and it looks to be working.

There are some issues in regards to her opening attachments and we'll try to nip that in the bud shortly tomorrow. If it's longer than 5 minutes I will open a ticket for that one in the meantime I'll leave this open for one more day before closing.
