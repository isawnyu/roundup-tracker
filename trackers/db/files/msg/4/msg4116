Hi,

We\'ve been having trouble printing to the copier on the 6th floor. Whenever we print, the \"data\" light on the copier flashes green but never goes through unless the printer is turned off and on again (for each print job). Whitney thought this might be a networking problem? 

Thanks for you help,

Julienne
