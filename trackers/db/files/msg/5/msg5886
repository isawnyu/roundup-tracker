<p>I am unable to install Chinese or Japanese on my computer.</p>
<p>Microsoft's website claims both that I should be able to (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/972813">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/972813</a>) and that I am unable to (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/compare?T1=tab01">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/compare?T1=tab01</a>) install them with my current version of Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer store software expert has never heard of Windows 7 Ultimate, says the problem is not relevant to most NYU students/staff, and suggests downloading from the website.&nbsp; There is no downloadable language pack on the website.</p>
<p>Can I use downloadable Windows 6 language packs?&nbsp; Or do I have to buy the $220 Ultimate version?</p>
