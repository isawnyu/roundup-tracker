Dental school event on April 6&7: They need a projector and screen in the oak library on both days.  The workshops are supposed to start at 8:30am on both days.  If you are able/willing to come on Monday morning, I will also be there.  I could probably then take care of everything on Tuesday morning since it will all be set up already.

They've requested wireless access, and I will double check that they have an NYU login to access.  

Let me know what I can do to help.
