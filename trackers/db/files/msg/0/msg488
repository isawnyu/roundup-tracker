updated text, but I think this part needs to be revised as well - please advise if it should be deleted or replaced with new copy:

Applications should be submitted electronically through the ISAW on-line application, where full details of required documentation are given. Applicants should have their doctorates in hand by the beginning of their period of appointment at ISAW. Students still in doctoral programs are not eligible for appointment under this program. Inquiries should be sent to Professor Roger S. Bagnall, Director, Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, 15 East 84th St., New York, NY 10028 (roger.bagnall@nyu.edu). Review of applications will begin on December 15, 2008.
