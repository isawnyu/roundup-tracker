<p>John B here...&nbsp; I know Mike has been speaking to you about his need to connect remotely to the building's BMS system.&nbsp; This is really a critical need and I would appreciate it if you could make this a high priority.&nbsp; You can solve the problem in whatever way is easiest for you, but he really needs this connection re-established.&nbsp; It would be fine if you could get it working again remotely from the laptop.&nbsp; Even better if he could have remote access from his home computers (perhaps as a remote connection to his ISAW computer?)&nbsp; Anyway you choose to solve the problem is okay by us.&nbsp; We appreciate your making this a priority.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>John and Mike</p>
