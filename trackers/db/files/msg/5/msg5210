per email from Diane, Beate has no internet connectivity from the machine in her office. I've recommended that Diane contact ITS to get the ball rolling while Christopher is in transit. It's going to be ITS's problem anyway and she's better positioned today to give them the details than we are here in California. 

Irene reported that Jennifer was having a similar problem late yesterday (see ticket 866593).
