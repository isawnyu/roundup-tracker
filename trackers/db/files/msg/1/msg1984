Hi Michael,
May I kindly ask your help in some matter. I need to get access to a site which I cannot open on my laptop, and I do not get into my office before Thursday to try whether it would work on my desktop. I need to get access to natc@cdl.museum.upenn.edu.
The person I am cooperating with told me the following about what I need:

&quot;Okay.  Just so you'll have something to say to your computer person,
cdl.museum.upenn.edu is a unix site. To connect interactively (i.e., to
run programs) you need a telnet/ssh client and to transfer files to your
own site you need an scp/ftp client.  One of the most popular telnet/ssh
clients is called PuTTY and a common scp/ftp client (for windows) is
winscp.  Both of theses can be freely downloaded from the internet if you
don't already have them.&quot;

Does this tell you something? I was wondering whether you would be in on Thursday June 10th? I plan to come in on that day, and then we could perhaps talk about it? I could meet between 10 and 11.00, afterwards I have got some meetings.
All best,
Beate
