Hi David,

I'd be happy to help you take a look at the wifi setup.  Today is a bit tight, but I should be in my office, room 509, between 12:00 and 1:00.  If that's short notice.  Tomorrow I am here between 10:00 and 2:00 and Thursday I am free between 10:00 and 11:30.  Please just let me know what seems convenient for you.

Best,
Michael Edgcumbe
IT Graduate Assistant
