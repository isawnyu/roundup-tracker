<p>S&ouml;ren hasn't migrated to Google cal or the configuration has expired or something along those lines. . Backup his current calendar before anything else and the migration should work and he should receive delegation for all of the calendars he has access to now. After that remove the old serv1.isaw.nyu.edu configration.</p>
<p>Email on how to do this was sent, it should be pretty straight-forward however. Also if his netid password doesn't work remember that he needs to setup a Google Apps Password as per the instructions. So he'll need to that before-hand but a year or more ago we had calendar migration so I'm sure this was done at some point.</p>
