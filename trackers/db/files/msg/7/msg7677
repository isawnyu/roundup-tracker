<p>To be explicit. The netid needs to not only exist but be activated. ITS regularly removes and/or deactivates netid for employees that either have left or are no longer active with the university. Which means even seasonal employees/users/administrators would need to have their netid reactivated. I'm not sure what the exact time limit is.</p>
