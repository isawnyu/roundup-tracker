There is a problem with backups here as it's only replacing backups for Kate's computer from Friday 5/20. WIll need to investigate but pretty much the backup server is out of space and this could be a trim issue or lock issue. Worst comes to worst I'll just search for all of the items modified from that date onward and move them to a folder for export.
