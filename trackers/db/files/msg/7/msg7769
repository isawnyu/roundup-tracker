<p>The only thing I haven't been able to order on our shopping list are the "Micro DVI to VGA" connectors for 2008-era MacBook Airs (cf:&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-DVI">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-DVI</a>). CDW lists them, but they are Apple products so we can't order them through CDW and the computer store doesn't list them via iBuy. Do you think we need them? If so, I will email the computer store and ask how we need to proceed.</p>
<p>Thanks, T</p>
