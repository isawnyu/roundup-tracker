<p>Here is what took place and we'll need to log this as an issue and keep this sticky.</p>
<p>1. Someone got both wireless microphones and hip transmitters, put batteries in, turned on mute and removed the batteries. The receivers will only release mute mode when powered on. Another transmitter was toggled to mute mode.<br />2. They then proceeded to turn off the main audio system from the master switch such that no audio worked at all.<br /><br />I'm not sure if someone is trying to deliberately sabotage talks, but there is simply no other possible explanation for this. I don't plan on "fixing" this again because it's not an IT issue. So, whomever is doing this, needs to have their behavior curbed.</p>
