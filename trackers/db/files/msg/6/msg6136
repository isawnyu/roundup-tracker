<p>Just to follow-up/annotate our conversation on Friday: please get with ITS and find out how we get a cost-estimate for this sort of work before committing, since this will have to be approved through Roger and probably LLF.</p>
<p>CCing Diane since this will become, in part, a building issue. Diane: the issue is we're out of network ports in the IT space and need more. ITS won't authorize us to put in a little desktop switch of our own; they insist everything has to be run back to their main switches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggest we change the ticket title to something like: get more network ports in 605-606.</p>
