I just heard that we will have a delivery of 80 boxes of books tomorrow - Wednesday - in the morning.

In the absence of an elevator these will have to be stored in the basement.  Dawn and I just surveyed the space we have access to, and the only suitable place is the lunch room.

Please advise where we should put the boxes, if not there.

We specified an inside delivery, but I expect it would be prudent to have the hand-trucks available.

Thanks.
