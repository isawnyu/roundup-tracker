<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>Two (unrelated) library issues:</p>
<p>The public access terminal on the 5th floor is behaving a bit oddly.&nbsp; At startup, the machine is taking a long time to come up to the login.&nbsp; During the lag, a b&amp;w image of the earth flashes on the monitor.&nbsp; After a few minutes, the image of the earth becomes an image of the apple logo.&nbsp; Soon after that happens, the login screen appears.</p>
<p>As for the scanner (nemesis to all), I do want to have a conversation about its latest quirks so please stop by when you have some time.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dawn</p>
