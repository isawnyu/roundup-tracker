Hi Tom,

Can you please add the copy below to the events page?
Thanks! Again, I apologize for the last-minute, now that the Sarcophagus conference will be over after today I will be more on top of this. I was getting the wiki events page and the isaw events page mixed up in my mind and thought this info was already up.- Kate

October 6th: Visiting Research Scholar Lecture Series
Speaker: David Taylor

Time: 6:00pm


A Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire? The View from New York

The overwhelming majority of the surviving epigraphic texts of the Late Antique Roman provinces of Syria and Mesopotamia are written in Greek,
and in a number of recent books and articles it has been argued that Greek was in fact the ordinary daily language of the local populations. By examining
examples of the full available range of ancient linguistic evidence, and drawing on sociolinguistic theory about multilingualism and diglossia, this thesis will
be challenged, and a more complex pattern of language usage will be sketched out. The consequences of this for issues of local identity and culture will
then be explored.

David Taylor is the University Lecturer in Aramaic and Syriac at the University of Oxford, and during 2009-2010 he is a Visiting Research Scholar
at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, NYU.
