Hello Tom and Michael,

If possible could you please make a couple changes to the exhibition website. 

1. the title of one of the public programs (http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/exhibitions/oldeurope/publicprograms.html) from "Christine Ghezzo & Company" to "Christine & Dinu Ghezzo and Friends".

2. put "**Free guided tour every Friday at 6 PM" on the location and hours page (http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/exhibitions/oldeurope/location.html) under Free Admission.

Thanks so much,
Irene
