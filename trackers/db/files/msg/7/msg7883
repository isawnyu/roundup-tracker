<p>This morning Stephen reconnected this machine to the Ulysses domain and we were able to move forward here. All programs are installed and functioning properly. The only thing that remains is the printer which I'm not sure why the laserjet is malfunctioning. It doesn't seem to be a power issue, so I suspect something is going on with the onboard USB there. The printer on the 3rd floor Diane set aside is being put into place but unfortunately it doesn't have the power cord with it. We'll need to purchase one outside of iBuy. There are a couple of used ones available on Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/HP-0950-4404-AC-Adapter/dp/B001DC01DU">http://www.amazon.com/HP-0950-4404-AC-Adapter/dp/B001DC01DU</a></p>
<p>If we can get this for Mike&nbsp;as soon as possible&nbsp;it would be great, otherwise he will need to have a new printer purchased. Also because this is an ink printer we should probably order some extra cartridges as well.</p>
