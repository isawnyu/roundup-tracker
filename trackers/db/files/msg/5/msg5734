<p>There is a search box at the bottom of the page. You don't have to memorize priority or topic. Also tracking numbers are sent directly in email and because tickets are sorted via priority the ticket numbers would never be in order so I'm not sure how much of a help it would be.</p>
<p>If search is not working for some reason let me know.</p>
