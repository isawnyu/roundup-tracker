<p>Had a discussion with the vendor sales guy yesterday afternoon (23 July). He's sent me a features overview video, etc. which I'll try to review today. Next step will be to schedule a demo. If it still looks good after that, we'll have to commit to some costs -- month-by-month -- if we want to really drive the thing for real.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And costs to do everything we're talking about doing are more than the folks who referred us think.</p>
