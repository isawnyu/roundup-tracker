<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>Please have Dwayne clean out carrel 5-9 and also wipe down the other 5th floor carrels that he already cleaned(the tops are a bit dusty). There are 4 remaining scholars in carrels that will need to be cleaned when they vacate Monday-Wednesday of next week.</p>
<p>Also, the empty carrels on the 4th floor (students) need to be cleaned up for the new incoming students. They mostly just need to be dusted off.</p>
<p>Come see me if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Thanks! - Kate</p>
