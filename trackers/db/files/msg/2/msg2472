Dear All:
The Lod Mosaic roundtable will be taking place on Saturday, October 2. I have emailed the 4 participants who will be presenting about their AV needs. I have strongly recommended using an ISAW computer with presentations pre-loaded. I will be present for the roundtable to make sure things go smoothly, so should be fine. I would like to request that Michael help me out on Thursday Oct 1st with making sure I have all the microphones hooked up correctly. Thanks, Kate
