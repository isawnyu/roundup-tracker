Hi Michael,

I need to add the following things to the list of programs to be installed on my computer when you return:

*BRIO plug in (in parallels)
*The Dymo label writer has somehow paused itself and won't allow me to restart it without the administrative password.
*Parallels is telling me there is an update available that can't be installed without the administrative password.

Thanks,
Whitney
