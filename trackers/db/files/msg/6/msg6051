<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>Chuck and I have been doing some box organizing on the 5th floor in preparation for relocating some cartons.&nbsp; We now have boxes of trash as well as flattened boxes that are ready to be moved to the basement.&nbsp; Will you ask Dwayne to stop by the library so I can show him what needs to be discarded?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dawn</p>
