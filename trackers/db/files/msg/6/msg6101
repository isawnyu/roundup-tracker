<p>Dear Christopher.<br /><br />TLG has sent me this explanation; apparently it is a problem with an NYU IP address. I don't know how to change this and have tagged/ticketed it; please, I need to be able to use this site for my research as soon as possible.<br /><br />Dan Caner<br /><br />------------<br />Daniel F.
