I realize that you've already tried to reassociate the link with Acrobat Reader, but perhaps something in the registry is not reading PDFs as PDFs.  So, with that in mind, the above link suggests that there might be a slightly different way to &quot;Open as&quot;?  

Unfortunately, I can't think of a way to duplicate the problem here on my virtual machine, so solving it will be a little bit of bobbing for apples.
