Hi Micheal,

Sorry to write so often, but it seems this Tuesday I was so unlucky. The plug stand on under my carrel is loose, and I suddenly realized that it has made my pc unplugged, and my pc has been working on battery.

Also, I faced another problem: I noticed that each time my PC goes on battery, it deactivates my internal network. I checked the other option for aalways being activated but each time it deactivates automatically. Maybe, you could help me with that also.

Thank you very much,
Mehrnoush
