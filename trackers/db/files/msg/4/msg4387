Christopher:

As of this morning (20 April) Jennifer is still waiting for a reply from the loaning institutions about the camera. 

Also, there is significant concern among cabinet members about this effort because it sounds like we're talking about 8 hours of complete downtime. Is that the maintenance window, or will phones and network be unusable for that entire time? If it's 8 hours of no use, we have a significant problem that needs to be discussed at my level (with you too) with a counterpart downtown involved in technical decision making (not just a scheduling person). 

So, you and I should talk about this before any final schedule is made.

Thanks,
Tom
