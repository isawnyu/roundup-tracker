I appear to be unable to save files to the server. I have tested inDesign, jpegs, and Word documents and receive error messages every time; I have also tried saving the file to my computer first and then moving the file to the server, which has also been unsuccessful.  

I was able to save .tif files to the server back in February, (although in that case the original files were already on the server and I just saved them under different names as I altered them in Photoshop). If someone could look into this soon, I would appreciate it, as we have several pending projects that would be easier if I can share files on the server.
