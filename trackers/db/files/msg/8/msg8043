<p>I was trying to share a document with Julianna via the server today but when the Finder window on her computer is pulled up, it does not show the ISAW Server as being connected. (In fact her entire "shared" section is empty.)&nbsp; Julianna says it was working last week, and it was definitely working during the summer so I'm not sure if this is connected to the other network issues that have been floating around the building or not.&nbsp; If someone could come look at it (Julianna works Tuesday and Friday afternoons so it will be free the rest of the time), that would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
