I spoke with Oscar Ramos at NYU's Department of Public Safety Technology Department.  I explained to him the chain of events that lead to our concern over the alarms and the time frame and current climate control of the work.  

Our alarm systems are monitored by NYU through the IP networking equipment on the third floor and basement.  Turning these systems off would sever our link to the monitors who are providing security from downtown.  The systems might work locally in that case but only within the building.  He also pointed out that a prolonged exposure to extreme climate may affect the DVRs that record the video stream.

We recognized that at this point the probability of this event is very low, but that it was useful to have this information.  He asked me to send a precautionary email to dps.repairs@nyu.edu advising them of the work and time frame.  I will copy Suzan and Tom on that message.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
