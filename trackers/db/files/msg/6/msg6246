<p>Christopher modified permissions more (for future reference, combining "manager" and "owner" roles should be an effective "force it" workaround). I just spoke with Ellen on the phone. Have verified that she can now get into her profile and can see the edit menu option and gets the appropriate form etc. when she clicks it. I'm going to hold this ticket open for 24 hours just in case she runs into any further trouble.</p>
