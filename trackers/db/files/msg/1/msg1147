Mernoush,

I checked a few things while you were away from your desk.

1)  The data jack is definitely not active.  We should be able to get it turned on.
2)  Your laptop picks up a strong signal in Marek's carrel.  Your location may be a contributing factor to your problem to connect, and I would like to investigate the issue further.
3)  Your laptop does not connect to the LAN on a known working data jack.  This could be caused by: incomplete registration from last week, faulty ethernet port, some unknown factor.  This is also something we will have to discuss, but I intend to check with ITS to find out if your MAC address is on file.

I will be back on Monday to continue working with you. 

Best,
Michael
