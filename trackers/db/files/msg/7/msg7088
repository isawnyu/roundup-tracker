<p><span>Hi Carlos,</span></p>
<div>We have a cisco aironet that is solid green, it's always blinked solid green but i'm now reading that this means it's not associated with any other access point. The mac address is&nbsp;5475D0297328, do you know if this was by design or does it need to be associated with all the other access points. We had this point down for sometime during our renovation on the 6th floor.</div>
