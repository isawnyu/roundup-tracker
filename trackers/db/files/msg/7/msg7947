<p>The software for these kiosk machines requires a resolution of 2560x1600 and can't be scaled down to a lower resolution without reprogramming the website. Alexander sent the information for their contact, Hutomo Wicaksono so that I could get either a scaled down version or something else. Unfortunately, I have heard nothing back yet so we assume he is on vacation. There isn't much that I can do in the meantime, when the reprogrammed archive is sent hopefully this can proceed. The machines are currently in 605/606.</p>
