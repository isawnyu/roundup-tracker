<p>I spoke with Daniel and sent the screenshots off explaining the problem. I have yet to hear back but an off the cuff analysis was the there was some confusion between his unicode program, microsoft office itself and the underlying osx system libraries for keyboard input. I'll wait to hear more or if this is a known issue.</p>
