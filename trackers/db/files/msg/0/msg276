This is a good idea, but I'd rather not have it linked for reasons I'll explain.  Right now the site isn't linked to or from any other site on the internet so 'spiders', which are programs that search the web for new sites, can't find it.  This keeps good guys like google from finding it, but it also keeps bad guys like spammers from finding it.  Since the ISAW site is linked to the rest of the web a spider could find our helpdesk if we were to link to it and I don't want to get a bunch of requests for nigerian bank scams.  Also, everybody in ISAW knows about it and I'm directing people who haven't used it to the site and almost everybody is using it now.  I agree that is would be nice to have a link to the site, but given the threat of spammers flooding my inbox I'd like to keep it hidden in plain sight.

I think a related idea would be to add a link somewhere on our website for 'problems viewing this page' or something similar and have that direct to me.  What do you think of that as a compromise?

Thanks,
