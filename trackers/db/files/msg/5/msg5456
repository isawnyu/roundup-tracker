<div>Hey Tom,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you aren't out of the gates yet this is low priority but i'd like to get it nailed down before I leave for vacation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>I just got back from updating Roger's computer. The problem is it is still updating because the machine only has 1 gig of ram. Which is being used by all of the background processes (virus scanning, backup, categorizing of files, indexing, updates, etc), which means it's extremely slow. As in something that should take all of 10 minutes is taking close to an hour of swapping in and out.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The machine needs at least 4 gigs of ram DDR2 non-buffered only. Which should be fine for sometime.</div>
