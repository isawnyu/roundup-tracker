<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Dear Tom,<br /> <br /> I just realized a few minutes ago that the default name for my e-mail account was "Lanying Tseng" (an incorrect form of my legal name, Lan-ying Tseng), not "Lillian Tseng" (my academic name). It appeared to happen after the Google migration. Even I set up my default name as "Lillian Tseng" at Thunderbird, it would still be reverted to "Lanying Tseng" when the e-mail was out. <br /> <br /> Could you help me to rectify the issue? People generally know me as "Lillian Tseng," not "Lanying Tseng." I don't want my e-mail to be deleted before it is opened and read.<br /> <br /> Thanks,<br /> <br /> Lillian</span></p>
