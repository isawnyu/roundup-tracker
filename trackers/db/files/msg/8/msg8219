<p>When the computers in the gallery attendant's office are turned on before the exhibition opens each day, the bluetooth set-up assistant automatically goes on. &nbsp;This seems to be interfering with the wireless signal, resulting in an inability for the images of the sculptures to load. &nbsp;Also, a dialogue box with software updates pops up each time the computers are turned on. &nbsp;For some reason the computers are unable to connect to the app store and update themselves. &nbsp;We need this issue solved before the end of the day on Friday, October 5 so that it does not happen over the weekend, which promises to be a busy one due to the Open House New York event.&nbsp;</p>
