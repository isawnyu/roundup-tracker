<div>Hey Tom,</div>
<div><br />In lieu of a more perfect teleconference solution that is to arrive some day and also based on the fact that it will begin to become a nuisance for all parties involved. After this mornings failure i'd like to go ahead and suggest the following device be purchased for review on the 6th floor large conference room and possibly the Seminar room.</div>

<div>If the unit works as advertised, and doesn't need to be sent back to the manufacturer, it will go a long way into making sure that not only Roger but the rest of ISAW has an interim workable teleconference solution. The unit is also available on Amazon for approximate $50 USD less at $177 USD.</div>

<div>Thanks!</div>
