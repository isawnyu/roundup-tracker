<p>Does the digital projector in the Seminar Room require a VGA interface or can one use USB/HDMI?&nbsp; Do we have a VGA - USB dongle at ISAW?&nbsp; My computer does not have a VGA port so I am just trying to figure out whether I need to pick up a dongle before I give my presentation tonight at 5PM.</p>
