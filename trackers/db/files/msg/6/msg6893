<p>There is now a smtp server setup on automaton.isaw.nyu.edu that will relay messages from BMS for alert/email issues. John and I had a conversation this morning to see this remedied and Steve Camp and squad added the information I gave them to BMS. Mike K still needs his Remote Desktop which is completely different issue. We now wait to hear back from John in regards to email but I will be following up with John when I get a chance.</p>
