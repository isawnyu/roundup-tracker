<p>NYU has a campus-wide site license for Mathematica 7, which permits qualified faculty, staff, and postdoctoral students to purchase discounted annual licenses to use the software on University-owned computers. Single-user licenses can be purchased from ITS. A free home-use license is provided to purchasers of single licenses.&nbsp;The annual fee for single users is $165 for the software and $15 for the CD containing the software.</p>
<p>Faculty, staff, administrators, or departments who wish to join the site license should send email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hpc@nyu.edu?subject=Mathematica%20Site%20License%20Request">hpc@nyu.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Alex: it will probably be fastest for you to contact them directly at hpc@nyu.edu and provide them with the necessary details to charge this to your research funds, etc. But do let us know if you run into trouble and/or need help getting this. It would also be helpful to know when the matter is resolved and how you found the process.</p>
