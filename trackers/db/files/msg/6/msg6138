<p>Reply from Meredith Rendall. I aim to act on this today (10/17):</p>
<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I was just thinking of you over the weekend. &nbsp;Things with the Computer Store aren't in operation yet.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you will send me:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>* Exact number of seats you need</div>
<div>* Whether those are standalone or networked (are they installed on one person's machine for their sole use or will you be utilizing a license manager to manage your licenses)</div>
<div>* Fiscal contact</div>
<div>* and chart field we can charge for the above licenses</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also please confirm that all licenses are for academic purposes (not building management, for example).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once we have that, I'll provide you with a log in to the download manager so you can download and install AutoCAD for Windows (we are not currently licensed for AutoCAD for Mac).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Meredith</div>
