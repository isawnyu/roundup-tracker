<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>The scanner is exhibiting some quirky behaviors during the save/send process.&nbsp; When a flash drive is inserted, sometimes the presence of the drive is detected, and sometimes it is not.&nbsp; If the drive is recognized, and the patron chooses "save to USB" a message pops up that says: "sending email ... 50% completed."&nbsp; At that point, the message box disappears, and the screen with the save options is grey.&nbsp; It appears that nothing is happening, and that the machine has frozen.&nbsp; However, if the drive is left in place, eventually the machine finishes the save process.&nbsp;</p>
