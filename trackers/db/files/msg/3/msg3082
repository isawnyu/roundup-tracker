We will not be moving the HP color printer from 3 to 6. Jennifer & exhibitions team agreed that when they use color, they need ledger format, which is only available on the 4th flr printer, which will not fit in any of the printer spaces on 6. You can close this ticket. 
(Note: That means we have one printer outlet live on 6 that's not being used.)
