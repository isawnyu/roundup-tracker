<p>Every morning since Ben upgraded me to Lion, I get a message that says I'm not connected to the ISAW network. When I don't reply, it asks me to sign into the NYURoam Guest Wireless Access. Obviously I am not doing this and I am connecting to the internet and the ISAW network.</p>
<p>It feels like I've traded one set of error messages for another.</p>
