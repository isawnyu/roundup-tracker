<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>Sebastian, a great friend of the scanner,&nbsp; reported that the scanner is producing files that are very light (contrast) so as to be unusable.&nbsp; He mentioned that he attempted to compensate for the contrast by adjusting the settings, but that the scanner did not appreciate the meddling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also had a few patrons comment on the unusually large file sizes that are generated.</p>
<p>All for now.</p>
