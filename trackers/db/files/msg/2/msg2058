The library staff will be having a meeting in the seminar room from 12-2 pm on Wednesday July 28 and will need the laptop, projector, and the ability to use Skype during this meeting.  They did include this on the event request form they put in last week, but as I was on vacation today is the first day I was able to address it.

Thanks,
Whitney
