<p>Hello Chris,</p>
<p>Everytime I open Word or any other Office program that was installed on my work laptop, I keep receiving a message saying that Office has not been activated (also, the bar on top of the screen is red with another message that says "Product Activation Failed"). Do I need to get a MAK (I only have the regular product key) or is the activation something that has to be done by your department?</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Nico</p>
