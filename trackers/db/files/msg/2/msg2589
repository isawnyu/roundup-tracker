Hi Michael,

The exhibitions department needs a bridge line to ring on my line (212.992.7859). We will use this line as an RSVP line for exhibition events and openings and also to provide information about the exhibition. I will need to be able to change the voice mail and callers need to be able to leave messages. I am sorry for the urgency but we need this done as soon as possible (by this Friday) because we need to print the number on the opening reception invitations that we need to send out this Friday.

Thank you and please let me know if you require any other information.

Thanks,
Irene
