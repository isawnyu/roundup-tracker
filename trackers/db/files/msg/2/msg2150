I just got off the phone with Sarah again and they are sending out replacement packaging. A customer relations representative will be calling tomorrow to confirm before they send out the packaging. Once the packaging is received and the computer scanned for delivery. The replacement unit will be shipped to ISAW. When customer relations calls I'll try to get a better timeframe as to when we can expect this to occur.
