<p>My gcal settings provide "view availability" to all NYU affiliates (it hides details, but shows busy/free). The first screenshot attached demonstrates this. I have cycled the setting (turning it off, saving, back on, saving) in case something was stuck in the tubes. The second screen shot, which I'll post momentarily, shows the result (i.e., no obvious change).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diane: if you need me to authorize a particular, non-NYU account, please let me know.</p>
<p>Diane: if this doesn't work, then we'll have to escalate with downtown.</p>
