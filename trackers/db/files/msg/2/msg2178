Hi!
I'm on the 5th floor (5-4) and the locks of my two middle cabinets on the top of my desk are not working. Well, actually locks themselves are working, but the hooks for the left door (the ones without lock) are too loose, and therefore even when locked, I can still open the cabinets. 
I'm not certain that my explanation is clear! But if you could fix it, it would be great.
thanks
Caroline
