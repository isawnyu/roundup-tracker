Hi michael,

It seems that my problem is fixed just whenever there is somebody to whom I can report. After you left, I tried the whole afternoon and I couldn't print neither with wired nor with the wireless connection. This time all print task would remain in the queue and none of them were sent to the printer. Can you set up my driver another time, or whatever you find helpful.
