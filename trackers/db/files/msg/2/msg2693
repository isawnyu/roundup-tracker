Hi,

The basement bathroom needs a thorough cleaning and its status should be checked on daily, as Kathy reports she is finding a mess in there frequently.  With the opening of the exhibition in two weeks, that bathroom will be getting more use by ISAW visitors and its cleanliness needs to be maintained.  (Also, Kathy should be able to use a bathroom which is as nice as the ones the rest of us are using.)

Thanks,
Whitney
