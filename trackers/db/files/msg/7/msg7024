<p>Yes, this is why I urge everyone to use the same password as it literally becomes a chore to try and manage and remember the deluge of passwords. It is a security issue should someone have one of your passwords but then you'd have to change both of them anyway. I know i've recommended <a href="http://www.lastpass.com">LastPass</a> before but we definitely should come up with some useful protocol that is less painful. When I clone myself we will solve this sign-on problem. In the meantime head to <a href="http://start.nyu.edu">http://start.nyu.edu</a></p>
<p>1. Login with your old netid/password<br />2. Select Change your NYU password and change it.<br />3. Select the NYU Google Apps for Education Password and change it to the password in number 2.</p>
<p>Anything that ask you for a password after that will take the new password. So for instance, your iphone etc.<br /><br /></p>
