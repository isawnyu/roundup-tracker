<p>Unfortunately there isn't anything I can do about the slowness, it's not a symptom but simply comes with the use of a Microsoft Windows system. It will continue to get slow over time, and your hard drive will need something know as a defrag but that should be a ways off yet. Your computer does have enough ram and we need to have the virus, trojan scanners scanning etc on load up. There's very little I can do about slowness, i'll take a look again when I get a chance but there is very little if anything that I personally can do.&nbsp;</p>
