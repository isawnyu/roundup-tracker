<p>The new Dell we purchased for my brio access is reporting this problem. I will undertake troubleshooting to verify it's a hardware problem (rather than a BIOS glitch) and will then contact Dell for warranty support if needed. Meantime, I'm going to try to leave it turned off as much as possible so as not to burn anything up.</p>
