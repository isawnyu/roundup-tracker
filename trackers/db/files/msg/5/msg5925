<p>At Tom's meeting with faculty about the ISAW website and faculty cvs, he showed that we could add other materials, e.g. supplementary pages, to our personal parts of the website. Could I have a reminder of how to do this? I presume it's not something I add while looking at my faculty profile, since the "Add new" menu there only seems to allow adding a new cv.</p>
