Refrigerators are set at 35 and freezer at 1.
Fridge is going up routinely to 42 and freezer to 10 (when they are not being opened).

Cleaning supplies to change the filter and clean the fan assembly were provided to Dwayne months ago. Please clean and monitor the temp to see if it improves. Please coordinate with Kathy and Diane on outcome.
