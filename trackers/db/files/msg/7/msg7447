<p>Recently Parallels on my desktop machine has been asking for an adminstrator password for Windows, which I do not have. Worse, when I tried to shut down today, it went into a seemingly endless process of allegedly installing Windows updates. It began before 9 AM and for the last couple of hours at least it is on item 8 of 11. I am reluctant to force a shutdown so will leave my machine on. I'd be grateful to have someone check in and do something about this today or tomorrow since I'm not planning to come in again until next week.</p>
