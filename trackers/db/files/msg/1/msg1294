Michael:

Tim Libert has written to me saying:

"Can you please drop me as a moderator on this list?  I'd still like the receive isaw-info messages, just not the moderator ones."

He may well have more than one user defined on that list (one for admin and one for regular receipt). Whatever the case, we'd like to make sure he's got no admin subscriptions and only one regular member subscription.

I'd have done this myself, but I don't think I have admin on that list.

Best,
Tom
