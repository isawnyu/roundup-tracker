Hi Mike,

We are having a problem with the light switches in the library on the 3rd floor.  When I turn on the lights in the morning, some of the lights come on, but not all of them.  I have to play with the switch, turning it off and on, multiple times before all of the fixtures will light.  If you stop by the library, I will demonstrate the problem.

Thanks,
Dawn
