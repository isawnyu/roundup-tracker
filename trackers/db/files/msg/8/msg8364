<p class="p1">I'm having some trouble with my laptop, which I purchased through NYU last year (July 2011). Whenever I turn it on the fan gets noisy and the whole computer shuts down. I then have to restart it, at which point it shuts down again. I often have to restart the computer several times. I've taken the laptop to the Computer Store twice and each time they "fix" the laptop it comes back with the same problems. Also, last time I opened my laptop I got some messages saying that the security settings were out of date.</p>
