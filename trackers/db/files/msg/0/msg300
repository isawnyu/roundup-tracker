Hi Beatrice,

We checked Anna Kogan's profile again and fixed her permissions.  We also
tested the account to make sure it works like it does.  She should be able
to log in with no issues.  If she still experience the same problem, someone
will need go up there to take a look at her computer.  We were not able to
ping her computer, but we were able to ping other computers in ISAW group.

As a result from our testing, we changed her password to &quot;change!me&quot;  She
will need to change her password on her first log-in.


Regards,

Mark Liu
