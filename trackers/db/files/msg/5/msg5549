<p>I'm trying to just edit a profile that I already created in the Visiting Scholar page - Justin Leidwanger. I logged out and re-logged in, but now when I click on his individual page, it doesn't show me as logged in at all. When I go to another page, though, I am logged in (with my name in the upper right corner) as usual.</p>
