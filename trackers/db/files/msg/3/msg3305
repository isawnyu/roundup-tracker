I don't know if anyone has talked to the building staff, but the Egyptian (Amheida) students are going to be studying in the building starting 2/8. They will be working at carrels in the library, which will need to be cleaned off. The library staff is working on cleaning the books and materials off the carrels. Could Dwayne please clean off either Monday or Tuesday morning, first thing?

(Forgive me if this request has already been made.)
