<p>I've been spending some time learning how to improve my web page and have managed to publish my c.v. But the latter wasn't at all obvious (I had to put in a hard link to it, whereas I would have thought it would happen automatically). And we STILL have the idiotic "view all publications" when in fact they're right there, and "Recent Publications" is in fact all publications. This is embarrassingly wrong, and we really need to get this fixed.</p>
