Keith (forget the gentlemen's last name already) the person that deals with these request is going to handle this. He notes that he didn't receive anything last week so I sent him a copy of the email, and two faxes just now. He adds that these type of request take some time because they have to be vetted through some sort of security team and then he'll update me as to what is to take place next.
