<p>Chris,<br /><br />I understand that you are very busy but this cannot be put off any longer.<br /><br />I need some time to add all the information. The first home page needs to be live by early next week as the opening reception invitations are being mailed tomorrow. <br /><br />The rest of the website needs to be ready no later than August 27th so I have time to add all the information. <br /><br />This please needs to be a priority, that is why I opened the ticket a month ago.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Irene</p>
