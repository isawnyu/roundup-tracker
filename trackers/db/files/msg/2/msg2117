I went for the appointment at the Upper West side store at 12:45pm today Wed 9/15 and explained the issue. The optical drive, and the bracket for the hd/sleep/ir cable was also replaced. Unfortunately the laptop still does not work. 

I just got off the phone with Sarah at Apple 3:40pm

Apple is going to replace this laptop. Sarah is putting together all the necessary data on her side and will call me back in 5 minutes. I will update when I know more.
