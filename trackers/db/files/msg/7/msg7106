<p>Gave box.com a call and had a conversation with one of their sales rep over there. It seems that there is some form of deal they are having with internet2 enabled universities and someone will call me back sometime within the next couple of hours. The contact information here at NYU for Internet2 related activity seems to be&nbsp;<strong>digital.studio@nyu.edu </strong>but I don't plan to move forward here until we trial with between 7-15 people at ISAW first. I'd like the trial to extend for some weeks actually as it would provide a general overview as to whether the service would be useful for us going forward etc etc.</p>
