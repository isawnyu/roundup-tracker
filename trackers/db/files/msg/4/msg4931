Yesterday an email Kate sent to me to my nyu.edu address never came through. I also suspect other emails missing! One of them is especially important: a booking confirmation for a flight to Europe which I URGENTLY have to forward to Tiffany for reimbursement. I am not in the institute today but you may call me on my mobile. This is urgent!
