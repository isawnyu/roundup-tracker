<p>When I turned my computer on this morning, instead of the normal start up screen (where I would choose between myself and the isawit profile), I got a screen offering me the option of virtually everyone at ISAW.&nbsp; When I selected myself, it asked me for a password -- neither the empty option (which always worked before), my server password, or my NYU Home password worked.&nbsp; I tried restarting the computer and now it just asks for a name and password, and no combination I can think of is working. Please help!&nbsp; I have several projects only located on that computer that I need to be working on today.</p>
