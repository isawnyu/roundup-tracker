My PC is not able to log me in properly at startup. It gives me a temporary permission, and loads my normal desktop and files, but warns me that nothing will be saved when I shut down. I tried to write down the exact warning wording, but it disappears too quickly (begins "Windows cannot copy file \\bobst.lib\Data\Profiles...."). My coworker is able to log into my computer without any problem, and I am able to log into a separate library PC without this problem.
