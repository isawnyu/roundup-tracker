I don't have control over email quotas - however, it is very easy to request more space.  When you are in nyuhome (http://home.nyu.edu) go to the link at the top 'ask its'.  In the box on the screen say you want your email quota increased and they should do it within 48 hours (usually less).  If after 48 hours you still do not have a quota increase please let me know - but this is by far the fastest way for them to do it.
