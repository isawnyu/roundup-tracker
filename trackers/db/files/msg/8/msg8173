<p>Update on my Time Machine issue (which Chris tried to fix earlier today before I could put in a ticket): The Time Machine backup actually looked like it was working for most of the afternoon -- I had a status bar that was indicating that it was running, and then right before it should have finished it gave me the message about the disk not being ejected properly and the backup failed.&nbsp; The weird thing is that this time, Time Machine is still showing as connected to my computer (where before the computer didn't seem to recognize it).&nbsp; So I don't know what is going on, but I guess it will have to go back on the list.</p>
