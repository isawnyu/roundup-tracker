<p>Hi:</p>
<p>Noone on my team can see my calendar or make changes to it. &nbsp;All are concerned about this because we have a big installation coming up and everyone needs to know where I am and what I am doing so that they can coordinate their schedules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any possible way someone can look into this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Jennifer</p>
