<p>Yes, I'd love to diagnose this but it will be time consuming and I really don't have the cycles right now.. Debugging and diagnosing a multi-threaded program like Mail could take weeks and even if we found the problem we couldn't readily fix it. I know no one at Apple on the mail team and all we could do is report it. That aside, if this is absolutely critical lets bump it to emergency. I'm cc'n Tom on the ticket so we can work on when time can be spent here if that is the case.</p>
