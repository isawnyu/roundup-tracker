<p>Diane:</p>
<p>I think we planned to read faculty onto this process as needed. So, passing it on to Alex at this point is a good idea. All ISAW affiliates should be able to read that page if they are logged into the website. If that's a problem -- or if they can't successfully create a draft news item and submit it for review -- they should open a ticket for further assistance.</p>
<p>I'm going to close this ticket as "resolved." Please open a new one if you or Alex encounters any problems with this process.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
