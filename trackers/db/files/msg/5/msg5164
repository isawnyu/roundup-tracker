Dear Chris,
My email is not working correctly yet. And I also wanted to ask you whether you found something out about theBlackberry problem. I am out of commission now for weeks with this damned transfer and really need these things to be looked at please. Please let me know when we can meet. I am here tomorrow (Thursday) and again next week on Wednesday. But perhaps you can just look at my computer in my office and check things.
Thanks,Beate
