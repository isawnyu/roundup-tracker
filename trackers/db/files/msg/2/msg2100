A fairly urgent question:

I'd like to set up a simple website for publicizing the conference and posting the program as it develops. Given your time and resource constraints, and my need to have a site that can be updated at least a couple of times between now and the conference, I'd like to suggest that I construct and maintain the site myself using the sites.google.com service, and that a link to the site would be added to the ISAW events listing for the conference. I have made such a site for the Commission for the History of Ancient and Medieval Astronomy, which you can look at here:

https://sites.google.com/site/chamaiuhps/home

Roger sees no objection in principle if you don't anticipate compatibility problems. (I'm not sure why any should arise since the conference site would be entirely external to the NYU facilities.)

I would run the draft website by Tom and Roger before going live with it.
