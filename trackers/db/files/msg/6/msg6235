<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>I can't add the following dates that the exhibition is closed to the <br />exhibition website. Is it possible to give me access to edit the "Learn <br />More" box on the left of the screen or can you add the following there?</p>
<p>Exhibition closed on Thursday Thanksgiving Day, Sunday Christmas Day and <br />Sunday New Years Day.<br />No free guided tour on Friday December 23 or on Friday December 30th.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Irene</p>
