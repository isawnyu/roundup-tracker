Judith is in my office. On her laptop, this email came through on her NYU email inbox, but when she clicked on the link to this ticket, it does not show as an active ticket. When you View Open tickets, this does not show. She only shows 2 closed tickets. She says it showed this afternoon, when she responded (above).
