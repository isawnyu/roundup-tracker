Michael:

I'd like to try a different method for participating in the next ISAW Cabinet meeting, scheduled for 8 July at 11:00 a.m. Up till now, we've been using Roger's speakerphone, but I'm having alot of trouble hearing people in the room (it keeps cutting off when the signal/noise ratio gets low).

Would it be possible for you to set up an ISAW-owned laptop with the bluetooth enabled Polycom conference unit in Roger's office for that meeting and monitor the startup of a skype connection so I can try participating that way to see if it provides a better audio experience? We can easily arrange a test in advance if you like. We'll keep the phone option as a backup.

Thanks,
Tom
