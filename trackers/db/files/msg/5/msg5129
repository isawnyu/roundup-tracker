Per Roger Bagnall Nate Nagy requires the ability to make administrative changes to scanner1 and scanner2. Therefore we need to change the admin password on those two machines so they are unique across ISAW and provide both Nate and Tom with the password information. Alternatively, if there's some other way to give Nate on-demand ability to modify all system settings and install software and fonts, we could go that route.
