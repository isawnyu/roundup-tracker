Hi Mike,

We will be having an event in the Oak library on Wednesday, April 27th. In order to accommodate some tables they will be bringing in for a dinner, we will need to push the furniture on the left side of the room (east) to the walls. We will not need to move the harvest table. Please see me if you have any questions. If we could do this the morning of the 27th, that would be great.

Thanks,

Kate
