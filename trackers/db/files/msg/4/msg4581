The doorknob to the electrical closet on the 3rd floor does not catch properly, so that it pops back open unless you close it very slowly and carefully.  Lately, it appears to be getting worse, in that sometimes it still pops open even if you are careful closing it.  It isn't particularly urgent, but if someone could take a look at it at some point, it would be much appreciated.
