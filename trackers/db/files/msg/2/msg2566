Tom,

I've been corresponding with Nina Berg about something similar.  She, John Bernstein, and Shelby all wanted access to the ISAW Events calendar.  The last message I sent was on Oct. 4th (see below).

Shelby has an account on the ISAW server which she can use for calendaring, but I don't remember the password.  It may have to be reset.  Right now, I believe she only has the ISAW Events calendar on her iPhone.  

The best solution would be to use the calendar information that she already has and sync it with her ISAW calendar.  Who is her assistant?
