Erik Hermans
Contact: erik.hermans@nyu.edu
Erik Hermans received his BA in Classics from the University of Nijmegen, the Netherlands in 2007, and received his MPhil in Classics from the same university in 2009. He has also studied at the University of Amsterdam (NL), the University of Ghent (Belgium) and the University of Oxford (UK), where his master thesis was co-supervised. His primary interests lie in the influence classical culture has exercised on all kinds of societies from Late Antiquity onwards. In his master thesis and other projects, he has focused on Late Antiquity and the Byzantine empire in particular. At ISAW Erik will study classical Arabic and hopes to compare how the classical heritage was dealt with in the Carolingian empire, the Byzantine empire and in the Arabic caliphate in the period 500-900 A.D.
