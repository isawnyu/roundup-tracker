My new MacBook Pro will not start.

It turns on, the Apple icon and progress wheel appear, then after a moment the Apple icon disappears and is replaced by a circle with a diagonal line through it, and there it sits.

I'm working in the meantime on the white MacBook we used for the skype meeting yesterday.
