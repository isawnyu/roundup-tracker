Ellen's floor is quite dirty with sand and I'm concerned about the floor. Could it be swept and/or steam mopped sometime soon? Not an emergency, but I don't want the sand to take off the finish.  I will ask Ellen to move her things off the floor to make it easier as she has some things stored under her desk.
