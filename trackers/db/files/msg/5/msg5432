<p>According to email from cwarner on 8/9:&nbsp;</p>
<pre>The Library Book Scanner is once again operational. After fixing the focus settings on the machine things should be operational. Please remember that should anything be wrong with the scanner in any fashion I'd appreciate an email me at <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:christopher.warner@nyu.edu">christopher.warner@nyu.edu</a>.
