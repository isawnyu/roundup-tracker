<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>I cannot get into the ticketing system with my NYU account and passwork. I am probably inserting wrong/out-of-date information. So, first, I appreciate if you help with that.</p>
<p>Second, I have had a lot of problems with scanner. The major problem has always been that it makes huge files and now it has gotten even worse. I adjust all settings to the least possible (200 dpi and grayscale) and for example a simple file of only text, 50 p, is 30 MB! I have asked some other people and it seems that this is a general problem.</p>
<p>recently, one problem has been added, the PDF A file it produces does not let me do any editing, like cropping, something I always do to clean the file.</p>
<p>It seems that I am nagging a lot! but, the files are just so inconvenient.</p>
<p>thank you so much,<br />Mehrnoush</p>
