<p>The book scanner scans in normal resolution by default and as such it will produce very large files. DPI or (Dots per Inch) are strictly for the spacing of dots in a specific inch and doesn't lower the resolution of the image, so the file size will still be large. In the process of scanning there is a button that says "Resolution" if you select that it will then say "Web" resoltuion with the words (for a smaller file size). If you select that, you'll get a smaller file size. Which should solve your problem, if you'd like you can also use the copier/scanner machine and they will do the same as well.</p>
