Roger, Christopher and I will be meeting with Shelby in the seminar room at 10:00 on Wednesday, 15 September. So I can "beam in", we'll need a laptop on the net with skype up and rolling. I'd also like Mikogo on the laptop (latest version) so I can share imagery from my desktop. We'll want the laptop video plugged into the big screen.

Thanks,
Tom
