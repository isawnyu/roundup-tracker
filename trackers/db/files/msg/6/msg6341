<p>I was just notified by an attendee of our events, that when you click on the ical icon on the website to add an event to your iCal, the incorrect time is entered. For example, tonight's lecture begins at 6pm. When you click on the the ical icon to input it into your calendar, however, it inputs it as starting at 8pm. It may be that it is mistakenly pulling the event end time and not the start time.</p>
