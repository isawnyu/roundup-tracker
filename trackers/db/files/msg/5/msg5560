<p>Beate: <br /> <br />I am sorry for the delay in responding to your request for help. I know how frustrating it is not to be able to receive important messages. Your initial note to Christopher arrived as he was leaving on vacation. I have been engaged in completing a number of urgent tasks that had languished because of the two-week viral illness with which I returned from Indonesia. Unfortunately, we are not staffed to provide quick-turnaround response to all IT problems, especially during vacation periods. <br /> <br />I will do what I can to help (Christopher is still on vacation), but, as I have explained before, Christopher and I are limited in what we can do to help with your email and Blackberry. These systems are controlled by NYU ITS; we have no administrative access to them. Moreover, we have no means of accessing your account information. <br /> <br />As to the Agade list: many lists will automatically (or manually, at the discretion of the list administrator), put subscribers "on hold" when their email address "bounces" (i.e., returns sent mail). Some systems interpret a vacation message as a "bounce." Unfortunately, I don't know what error message you're seeing because the response you cite was not attached to the message you sent me. In the absence of further information, I can see only two ways to halt this behavior: turn off your vacation message or contact Jack Sasson directly and ask for his advice (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:jack.m.sasson@vanderbilt.edu">jack.m.sasson@vanderbilt.edu</a>). Your message implies that you've already exchanged messages with someone associated with Agade; if "they" continue to tell you to contact "your IT people" you will need to open a ticket with ITS downtown as they control your email, not us (contact info below). <br /> <br />On the Blackberry: as with all ITS-managed systems, you'll need to open a ticket with ITS in order to get help. Whenever you have an internet connection, you can get the contact information for them by logging in at NYU Home (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://home.nyu.edu">http://home.nyu.edu</a>) and then selecting "Ask ITS". In case you are having trouble getting to the web, I copy the relevant information here: <br /> <br /><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.nyu.edu/its/askits/contactus/">https://www.nyu.edu/its/askits/contactus/</a> <br />IT Service Desk <br />Phone &amp; Email <br />1-212-998-3333 <br /><a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:AskITS@nyu.edu">AskITS@nyu.edu</a> <br />8:00am-midnight, Mon-Fri <br />Noon-midnight, Sat-Sun <br /> <br />In-Person Help <br />10 Astor Place, 4th Floor <br />9:00am-6:00pm, Mon-Fri <br /> <br />I don't want to open an ITS trouble ticket for you (as you originally asked Christopher to do), because then all their emails will come to me and that will only delay you getting the answers you need. <br /> <br />Please do let me know how quickly ITS is able to help you and whether or not they resolve the problems to your satisfaction. I have been in dialogue with them for some time about the quality of service they provide to ISAW. Your input in that regard would be helpful. <br /> <br />Please let me know if any of this is unclear or if you encounter troubles getting in contact with ITS. <br /> <br />Best, <br />Tom <br /> </p>
