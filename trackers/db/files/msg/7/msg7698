<p>Mike, We will be changing residents of office 603. I've moved all of Nico's belongings to one end of the desk/bookshelves and wondered if Dwayne could clean the rest (desktop, empty bookshelves and the floor) so we can have the new residents start moving their things in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks on behalf of all, Diane</p>
