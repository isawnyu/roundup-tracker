<p>latest from ITS: I'll follow up on the question they *didn't* answer (how to create new calendars for new rooms) once I get control of the existing calendars.</p>
<pre>This is the correct avenue.  If the owners are in the department, or coworkers, we would expect the clients to request access from the owner.  However, we can reassign the calendars to you as an owner.  Since those individuals are no longer with the department, you should go through whatever processes or notifications that your department deems necessary for removing access to a department resource.

I'll ask our tech to add you as an owner to all those calendars.
