<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>Irene has been trying to print to the 4th floor color printer and it tells her it is "locked."&nbsp; Exhibitions is on a deadline and needs to print to that printer as it's the only one that can handle 11x17 in color.&nbsp; Can you figure out what is going on, please?&nbsp; You can contact Irene directly (I just figured it would be faster if I sent the ticket as I have an account set up already.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Whitney</p>
