<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We've received the new microwave to replace the broken one in the 2nd floor kitchen.&nbsp; It's currently behind my desk -- if it could be unpacked and moved into the 2nd floor kitchen and the old one removed, that would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Whitney</p>
