<p>Sure you can go ahead and download the software now sans license. However i'd go ahead and wait for Tom's comments as to what we should do in regards to licensing. If it was up to me i'd say just get the Filemaker license from filemaker.com and let us get on with what needs to be done but I'm sure that would run afoul of some NYU stipulation.</p>
