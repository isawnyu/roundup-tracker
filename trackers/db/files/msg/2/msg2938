Hi Mike,

The following is a list of school groups that will be touring the exhibition. Most of the groups will have a guided tour in Gallery 1 that will last about 45 minutes. I have ensured that security will be here. There are two groups (Dec 6th and Dec 13th) that will have a lecture in the lecture hall in addition to touring the exhibition in Gallery 1. On the 6th we will occupy about 30 chairs in the lecture hall, however there is no need to remove any chairs. On the 13th could you please ensure that we have 95 chairs in the lecture hall, Alexander Jones has agreed to give them all a lecture. 

As always I am happy to discuss the details in person. 

Thanks,
Irene
