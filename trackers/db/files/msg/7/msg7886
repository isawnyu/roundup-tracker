<p>Yes, Whitney said that she is just using the existing power cord so I'm not sure where the other one went. If Dawn isn't using that one then I'll just cannibalize that one. I already took a look around and can't seem to find anything if you happen to come across any power adapter with a 3 pronged input. Mike could really use it.</p>
