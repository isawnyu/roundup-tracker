<p><span>Hi Christopher,</span><br /><br /><span>I just scanned an article and sent it to myself via email.&nbsp; Bookeye (the little liar) said it was sending the file.&nbsp; No email arrived (I checked my spam folder, too) and when I went back to the machine my images were gone and no one else used the machine during those few minutes.&nbsp; Is this "deleting of images" a settings issue?&nbsp; If not, we will need to do some investigating because that behavior is bound to result in angry patrons (far worse than angry birds).</span><br /><br /><span>Thanks,</span><br /><span class="il">Dawn</span></p>
