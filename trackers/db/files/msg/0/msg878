David,

This is Tim, the Systems Administrator from ISAW.  I was told you would need a computer for next year.  My personal recommendation would be to get a laptop since it is my understanding you will be in the office periodically and then purchase a desktop when you are permanently in the office.  Please let me know if this idea works for you and we can further discuss the specifics of what to get.  Also, could you please provide me with a list of any software you may need so I can initiate those purchases?

Thank You,

Tim Libert
