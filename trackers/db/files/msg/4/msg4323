Hi, I was wondering if there is any update on the license for the Acrobat Pro software that I installed on my computer and am currently using as a trial. There are only a few days left before the trial expires and I would like to know if there is a way I may get the license before the trial ends or if I need to uninstall the program (and then install it again?).
Many thanks!
