I've drafted the requested changes, making minor adjustments to the header information to bring the entry into alignment with the style that's now being used on the event page.

Please review the changes at:

And respond (via the link included in this message) indicating whether it's ok or not. Once I've heard back from you with approval, I'll push this out to the public version of the site.

Thanks,
Tom
