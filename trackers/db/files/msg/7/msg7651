<p>Also, your currently printer hooked up to the Dell will need to be migrated to the new machine, when you're ready to do that you should be able to. In the meantime all other printers in the building have been added and this machine added to isaw.nyue.du's network. We'll need to either purchase a switch to allow you to use an ethernet cable or come up with some other solution. Right now both ports are being utilized and to print to any other printer you need to be connected via ethernet cable.</p>
<p>The computer has wifi so it'll just need your netid and password to connect to the NYU wireless network in the interim.</p>
