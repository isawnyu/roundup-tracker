<p>On the front page at <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu">http://isaw.nyu.edu</a>&nbsp;there is a widget that scrolls events, news etc. Shelby mentioned she wanted to see some more images through out the site. &nbsp;The idea is that we add random images from the latest exhibition on the front page with a small blurb about the object. It would link to the overall exhibition page for the latest exhibition and the images would have to conform to a certain size, and be managed through an easy to use interface.</p>
<p>This would allay Roger's concern of too much image, and still satisfy Shelby's need for more visual balance while at the same time promoting exhibitions on the front page. I'll do a mockup when I have to work with the no events ticket sometime this week and post here. All around though it would serve to promote exhibitions just as much as events.</p>
<p>It would involve obviously getting pictures of the specific objects for each exhibition thrown into a folder somewhere.&nbsp;</p>
