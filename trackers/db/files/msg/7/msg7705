<p>The hard drives for the mirrored raid set are failing, disk6s2 is completely failed. This is currently in rebuild mode, unfortunately this leads back to <a href="issue1741" target="_blank">issue 1741</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should occur is that the raid slice is degraded and the server continues on with the degraded raid until it can be repaired or rebuilt. However OS X Server fails on an IOerror and simply refuses to continue service for anything else. The IOerror is simply for one of the failing slices and not the main master disk. In this case the server was available but in full failure mode around 7/12 at 11:50:05 pm EDT. It managed still to try to start it's print server around 12 midnight but that was the last thing that it could actually attempt at doing, this also failed.</p>
<p>It is hard to tell if the disk is indeed need of replacement at this juncture. At the very least the mach kernel will try to quarantine bad blocks and not reuse them. Unfortunately the disk will probably need to be replaced at some point and the raid rebuilt. Again, this current setup will need to be replaced. The time, strategic planning and resources need to be addressed here as it will indeed affect the whole workflow at ISAW.&nbsp;</p>
