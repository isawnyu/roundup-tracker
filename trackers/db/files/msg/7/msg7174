<p>Hello Christopher,</p>
<p>Now that the shelf units in the reading rooms on 4 and 5 are in place, we (library staff) want to have the public access terminals reconnected. Will you relocate the terminal from the 4th floor to its new home on the 3rd floor circ desk (sans computer cabinet), and reconnect the terminal in the reading room on the 5th floor?</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have questions or concerns.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Dawn</p>
