Hello,

On Friday, Chris lent me a flash drive onto which to copy a file named "Karen Rubinson" that is now on the desktop of the computer associated with the slide scanner.

My computers at home can't read it and keep asking me if I want to format the drive (which of course I don't).   Is there something simple that I don't understand that will make the file work, or should I come back to ISAW and recopy the file onto another flash drive?

Many thanks
Karen
