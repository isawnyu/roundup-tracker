<p>Contact at ITS is &nbsp;now Meredith Rendall () to whom I've written (8/31) as follows:</p>
<p>Hi Meredith: <br /> <br />Scott Jackson gave me your email address and suggested I contact you directly. <br /> <br />Here's our situation: <br /> <br />We have less than 10 (right now 2-4) faculty and visiting/senior scholars who would like to be able to use AUTOCAD on an ad hoc basis from time-to-time (for archaeological projects). I'm gathering more information about their specific needs, but I don't think any of them would be looking at using it regularly on anything like a 9-5 m-f basis; it would be much more episodic than that. The costs of standalone licenses for each of them are pretty much prohibitive as it stands now. <br /> <br />Does ITS have -- or foresee getting -- any AUTOCAD licensing solutions that we could participate in that might help us out? <br /> <br />Thanks, <br />Tom <br /> </p>
