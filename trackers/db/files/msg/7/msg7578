<p>I'll try to get the ball rolling on this tomorrow as for the backup, yes. You can backup the external drive to your current drive. As there should be enough space. I wont be at ISAW tomorrow but next time you're in let me know and we'll get it setup. Of course the drive must be hooked up for it to backup so you'll have to remember to do that otherwise it shouldn't be an issue.</p>
