<p>Hello Christopher,</p>
<p>Bad news on the scanner front.&nbsp; While using the scanner this morning, Peter was only able to scan one page (a blurry image at that).&nbsp; Once that page had been scanned, the scanner touch screen went grey, and we were not able to scan any additional pages.&nbsp; Will you stop by?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Dawn</p>
