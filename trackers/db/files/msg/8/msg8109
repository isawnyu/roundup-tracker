<p>We gave this a once over, updated all software remaning on that machine and things should be ok here. You can use the external speaker for Skype by simply plugging it in and the laptop should obviously be close to the speaker so that he will be able to hear what is being said. You can use the external speaker which is at the podium so that others will be able to hear his responses. There is probably a way to setup the external speaker to the overhead audio system but that would require much more sophisticated gear.</p>
