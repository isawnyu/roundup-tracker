I've told Matthias to we will forego any upgrade until June 2011. I think it best that whatever confusion is surrounding this be handled directly by you. You can contact him at ml219@nomad.ns.nyu.edu (Matthias Lee) from here I will facilitate that introduction.

As it stands, I'm not aware of any contracts made with ITS, any of our service agreements or anything that would put me in a position to have negotiation or conversation pass the rationalization of the technical issue. Also, there seems to be confusion about whom to contact in regard to ISAW infrastructure on both sides and that simply needs to be remedied.

Network infrastructure needs one point-of-contact who understands the cross-connects and can make proper decision as to what needs to be scheduled and when, as well as what is actually being plugged into the network in the building.

Sans all of that i'll stand by in aide however you see it fit to move forward.
