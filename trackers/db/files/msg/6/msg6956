<p>I'm going to call this one resolved; I haven't pulled the 320's due to time but I've zero'd out all of the drives leaving us with 4 replacement imacs that we can swap out should we need to, after that if there is a severe issue we have at least 4 useful drives, and enough spare ram to keep us going without needing to bleed much of anything beyond time.</p>
