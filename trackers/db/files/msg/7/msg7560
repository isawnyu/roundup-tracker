<p>This is an odd quirk: on google maps, if you type in&nbsp;"15 east 84th street", the pin drops at the far eastern end of 84th, over on Gracie Square. It has no trouble with other numbers on E84th, or with finding "Institute for the Study of the Ancient World". &nbsp;This came to my attention when one of our exhibition speakers, whom we put up at a hotel close by, typed in the address, printed the map, and walked a significant distance in the wrong direction.&nbsp;</p>
