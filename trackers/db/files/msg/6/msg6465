<p>You'll need to discuss this specific issue with Tom as this isn't within my domain of duties, or responsibility at ISAW. Setting up and/or compiling MySQL is a time consuming task that you probably should not be doing yourself on your main machine. It can quite frankly cause a lot of problems, especially given those directions. I've cc'd Tom on this email, also please make sure to use&nbsp;<a href="../" target="_blank">http://ticket.isaw.nyu.edu&nbsp;</a></p>

<div>It's not that I have a problem reading email, it's that I receive a lot of it, ISAW email is but a fraction of what I must sift through during the day. It helps me immensely in tracking these issues by contacting me through the ticket system.</div>
