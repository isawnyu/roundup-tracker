incorporate public events wording into existing website

&quot;Audio recording and photography of any kind is not permitted at ISAW activities without prior consent. Requests can be emailed a week or more in advance to isaw@nyu.edu.&quot;

This has passed legal with no changes to be used on our event and exhibit publicity and website.
