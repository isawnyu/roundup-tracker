Tim,

You'll have seen my email about "digital practice" seminar possibilities for this spring. For these, at a minimum, Sean, Hugh and I are going to want to be able to "beam in" and participate remotely. I don't think skype will support us with video (only with audio). I wonder if there are other possibilities, and with what level of tech madness. All three of us of course will be at home on cable or dsl conenctions.

I guess one possibility might be Second Life ... which I've never used but I think I've seem some folks using it for this sort of thing.

Anyway, what are the possibilities from your perspective? Do the folks in the Visual Studio have any help they can provide (maybe Jennifer Vinopal or her colleagues)?

Just wanting to get as much of a jump on this as we can.

Tom
