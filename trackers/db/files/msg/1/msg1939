Logging a problem with the monitor in the seminar room.  Caroline came to room 509 saying her laptop wouldn't connect.  I verified the cable was properly connected and attempted to detect displays, changed the input on the monitor etc.  The laptop did not recognize the connection to the monitor (no additional monitor in system preferences).  I brought her the floating macbook laptop to use for the presentation and it connected without trouble.  Suggested she make a ticket next week to troubleshoot the issue.
