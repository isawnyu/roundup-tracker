<p>Dear both:<br /><br />Christopher and I just had a meeting with the telecom folks. To get the IT office equipped with 24 extra ports (that's an 8-port patch panel on each of 3 walls) will cost ISAW $3912. This will give us plenty of capacity for servers, test setups, laptop/imac repair/training and temporary setups as needed so that we don't run into this problem again (something like this was what I wanted from the beginning, but our requests were ignored during the 6th floor buildout process). Modifications would occur only in the IT space (and wiring being fished behind the walls and above ceilings). No additional networking equipment or IT closet changes are required.<br /><br />They will be coming to survey on 7 December at 11 a.m. Christopher will meet them and guide them through the facility. The survey is aimed at designing the job and checking for potential hidden costs (which are not expected).<br /><br />Work would start on 12/15 or 12/16 and be complete by end of day 12/19. No systemwide downtime or after-hours building access is expected.<br /><br />Thoughts? Concerns? Tentative budget approval?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tom</p>
