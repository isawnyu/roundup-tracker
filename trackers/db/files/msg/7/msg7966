<p>Dear Tom,<br />I just came back to NY. As agreed, I am sending you a message with<br />regard to my laptop, which continues to have the same issues as the<br />old one (basically, I cannot save files of more than a few Kb on any<br />pen-drives [only on big hard-drives], and even when I can, those files<br />cannot be opened using other machines -as it happened at the last<br />conference, alas-).<br />Thank you,<br />Nicola</p>
