Michael:

I'd like to get you set up to do some hands-on experimenting and practice with our nascent news blog. You'll need to install the ScribeFire firefox plugin on your account(s) and then configure it to work with our blog.

Scribefire can be had here: http://www.scribefire.com/

I'll send you details on accessing the blog and configuring sf to work with it via email referencing this ticket number.

Thanks,
Tom
