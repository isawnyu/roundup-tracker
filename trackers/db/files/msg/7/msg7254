<p>Hi Tom,<br />How are you? It was great to sit at your workshop on Pleiades!<br />I was wondering if you have any information about the warranty of my <br />laptop. I am a bit concerned because in June I will start travelling a <br />lot and I will need to bring my computer with me. So, I would need to <br />know what will have to be done on my laptop soon enough...<br />Many thanks,<br />Nicola</p>
