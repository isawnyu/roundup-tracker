Dear IT support,

There are a couple of issues with my new computer:

1. I no longer have Adobe Acrobat Writer which is something I use during production to make corrections on PDFs. Can I have it re-installed?

2. I am not able to burn discs for some reason.... I receive an error message or it states that the information exceeds available space even though there should be plenty of room.

Many thanks,
Julienne
