I need to produce 3 copies of a DVD with a 1.4 Gb folder of images on it. We have DVD-R disks on hand, and my computer has a DVD drive. But when I put the disk in the drive, the computer tells me it's a CD, and it will not accept the order to copy to it a folder with contents larger than CD capacity. Any idea where the problem is coming from and what the solution is?
