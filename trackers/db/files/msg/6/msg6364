<p>The hard drive in Beate's machine is preparing to fail. It will need to be replaced, i'm not sure if Applecare is still active on the machine. What we are going to do in the interim is restore Beate to a different machine and pull the one that she is using currently for repair. Benjamin is working on this as we speak.</p>
