Anna,

For now, your third floor user code is 7813 and your 4th floor user code is 1010.  I know that seems confusing, and we are actively working to resolve the situation.  Suzan is currently creating a new master list of usernames and passwords that will be consistent for the Copiers and the Wiki, and we hope to deploy it as soon as possible,  Thanks for your patience.
