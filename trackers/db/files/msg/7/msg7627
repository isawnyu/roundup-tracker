<p>This has been fixed, there is a minor update problem but I'm attributing that to the fact that window updates server was having a minor issue. Other than that, Windows defender was activated, all relevant updates for everything on the machine were committed, trojan/virus definitions updated. The computer was fully backed up as well so that if this issue reoccurs we can easily just run from the clean backup. All Mike's data and programs were restored to the way he normally functions with them etc.</p>
