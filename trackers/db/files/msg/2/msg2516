Mike has already been notified about this, but I just wanted to put in a ticket so there was a record of the problem.  

The refrigerator in the basement kitchen stopped working properly today -- the interior temperature was rising, and condensation was dripping down from overhead in fairly significant amounts by the end of the day.  As I said, I notified Mike about this, and the refrigerator has been emptied and unplugged, which stopped the dripping. There shouldn't be any problems over the weekend, but we may need to call a repairman or take some other action to get it back in working order as soon as possible.
