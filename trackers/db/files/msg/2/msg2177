Joan,

The drivers for the Lanier printers are located on Lanier's website.  

http://lanier.com/downloads/driverFrame.aspx?path=http://support.aficio.com/bb/html/dr_ut_e/lan_u/model/mp45/mp45en.htm

The printers will also work with the generic drivers built in to OS X, but you may run into trouble if you're attempting to print double sided etc.

Please let me know if you have trouble installing them.

Best,
