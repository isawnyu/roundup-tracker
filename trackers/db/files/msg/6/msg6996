<p>Norm Yoffee is working in 403 for the week and has asked if it would be possible to get an Ethernet connection for that room.&nbsp; He has a long Skype conference scheduled for Thursday and would like a more stable connection if possible.&nbsp; I wasn't sure if we even have the jack activated in that room at the moment so I am opening this ticket to see if it is something we can arrange.</p>
