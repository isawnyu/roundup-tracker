<p>Hi Diane,<br /><br />Happy New Year!<br /><br />Thank you for re-sending the description of ISAW and the contact information. I actually see both the fund labels and the fund descriptions in the link that Aly sent on the top of the page:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nyu.edu/giving/make.gift/campaign.html?id=1000095" target="_blank">https://www.nyu.edu/giving/make.gift/campaign.html?id=1000095</a><br /><br />I think we are just missing the ISAW description and contact info? Am I not looking at it right?<br /><br />Aly, can you please add the description of ISAW and the contact info according to Diane's document? Thank you!<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Emily</p>
