<p>Have you talked to anyone at ITS about this? I'm concerned that slapping a WAP onto the network might cause trouble. At UNC they had intrusion detection gear on all the switches that would detect and "penalty box" any WAP that wasn't authorized. In any case, we do need to talk to ITS about the survey and what they're going to do about the findings, especially floors 1 and 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you please write to Stephanie about this, copying me. Tell her you'll be out of town after today so she should follow up with me.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
