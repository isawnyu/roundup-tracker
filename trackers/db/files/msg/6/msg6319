<p>Roger is going into a meeting right now, but he wanted to note that he is unable to send documents to the 4th floor printer.&nbsp; This appears to be the same problem Kate has been having.</p>
<p>According to his schedule he should be free from 3:30-4 today if Ben is available to take a look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
