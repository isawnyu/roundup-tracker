<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>This is John from the IT Service Desk, writing regarding your reaqest.</p>
<p>The best solution at this time is to have any visiting scholar call ITS.<br />Its can provide a weekly access login to nyu guest.<br />If you were to call ITS and ask for the credentials, we would provide it so you can provide it to the visitors at any time during that week.<br />The login credentials expire on Sundays at 11:59pm.</p>
<p>Hope this works for you</p>
