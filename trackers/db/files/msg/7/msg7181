<p><span>Hi Chris,</span><br /><br /><span>My new computer (a replacement for the sad old virus-ridden one) has</span><br /><span>just arrived! &nbsp;Is there sometime this week that you or Rohan could</span><br /><span>help me get it online? &nbsp;Also, do you by any change have an</span><br /><span>institutional copy of Office? &nbsp;I think I have one from last fall (that</span><br /><span>may or may not be good for a second usage), but I can't find it at the</span><br /><span>moment.</span><br /><br /><span>Thanks!</span><br /><br /><span>Best,</span><br /><span>Sarah</span></p>
