Dear Tim,

As you know, I am at Linda's computer this week as long as my own one is in service. To have access to the ISAW relevant files I need iWorks to be installed. I have downloaded the trial version which will allow me to open and save them in another format, but it needs the adminstrator's passwort to be installed.

Thanks, Christian
