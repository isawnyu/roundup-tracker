<p>Rohan and I took our first feeding of the beast stroll through-out the building. Jennifer's mouse is broken and needs to be replaced, her computer was updated to 10.7.3 combo pack and the backup drive was not seated all the way into the USB post on her imac. So for the last 32 days she wasn't being backed up.. These problems should be remedied. Rohan is going to give it a once over again after all this is completed.</p>
