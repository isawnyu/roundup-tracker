<p>We are currently using our reserve for Anshul and Monish and the last one I had here was wiped with Freebsd so that one needs to have OSX put back on there. Which will give us some buffer should something go run. It will need all the software installed etc etc. The extra machines cycled for Exhibitions we'll have prepped for emergency cases.</p>
