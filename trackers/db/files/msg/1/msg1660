Hi Mike:

Here are the details for set up for the Getty Board Meeting on Monday, March 15th (as per our brief discussion yesterday):

- NYU will deliver rectangular tables (6ft) and linen in the morning on Friday, March 12th. 
- The tables in the lecture hall set up "board room style" / a U shape. 
- Nancy will help set and iron the linen for the meeting.
- The lecture hall needs to be a good/reasonably comfortable temperature for the meeting on Monday, March 15th. The meeting is scheduled to begin 
at 8:15/8:30 am.

The lecture hall has to be set up by Friday, 2:00 because Julia Tranner from the President's Office will be here to view the space and because we won't have time to do this Monday morning at 7 am.

Best,
Suzan
