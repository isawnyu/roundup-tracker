<p>Just to keep this alove -- someone who came to last night's lecture was 20 min. late since he followed his map to the East River, before turning back to follow the building numbers. And since he arrived more than &nbsp;10 miutes late, he was not able to enter the lecture hall until the question time.&nbsp;</p>
