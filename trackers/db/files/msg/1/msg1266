The Horse is Man?'s Wings?: Archaeological Science and the Changing Nature of the Human-Horse Relationship in Central and East Asia in Prehistory

Speaker: Dr. Mim Bower, Cambridge University
Date: October 27, 2009
Time: 6pm


The relationship between horses and humans reaches far back into prehistory. At first, horses were a source of human food, but at some time in the past, perhaps during the process of domestication, horses took on a much greater role. Not only were they ridden, giving humans the possibility of travelling with great speed over large distances, or harnessed in chariots, which could be used to show status and power, they became venerated in a way that no other domestic animals have been. During the 2nd and 1st millennia BC, all across central and east Asia, in harness or with chariots, in groups, or alone, horses were buried along with their owners and carers, sometimes with the most amazing grave goods. Ultimately, an entirely new way of life developed from these practices: equestrian pastoral nomadism. But the importance of the horse in central and east Asia does not end in prehistory. The horse remains a powerful symbol in many cultures today and is associated with ideas of identity and nationhood. In this presentation, I will report on the results of a large interdisciplinary archaeological science project which explores the evolving relationship between horses and humans, from prehistory to the present day. Using a wide range of cutting edge archaeological science methods, including archaeogenetics (living population genetics and ancient DNA), geometric morphometrics, paleopathology, zooarchaeology and ethnography, we work towards an understanding of the changing relationship between humans and horses across time.
