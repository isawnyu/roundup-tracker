<p>I think that for the time being A3 and printer are enough. If we have no <br />space, the print can be also sent to one of the other printer at ISAW. <br />It is however important to have the possiblity to print A3 format. Do we <br />have such a printer at ISAW. In case of a positive answer, I would avoid <br />to buy a new printer and have to find place for it. As you know, space <br />is possibly the most complicated issue at ISAW. Ok, one of the...!<br />On the other hand having two screens is in my experience very useful <br />when working on materials and plans, because it allows you to make <br />inquiries or write text on one, and haveing images directly visible on <br />the other.<br />That's my suggestion.
