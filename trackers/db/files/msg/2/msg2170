Hi Mike,

The dishwasher in the basement kitchen does not appear to be working properly (there is still food on the dishes when the cycle is complete).  Can you please contact someone to come out and look at it? We should have this taken care of as soon as possible, before the new housekeeper and chef arrive.

Thanks,
Whitney
