The door to the kitchen & stairs on the 2nd floor suddenly opens very hard after about 12". Could be due to the change in weather & humidity. Has already been brought to Mike's attention. 

Unfortunately, this door is used daily for tea and coffee service that requires a trolley come through this door with hot liquids and dishes. 

Mike is also aware that the Neugebauer conference in the Lecture Hall dictates it cannot be addressed until next week. We'll do what we have to do for now.
