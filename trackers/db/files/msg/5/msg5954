<p>To do mass files at once time, you can change the state on all of them at once, for instance in chama you just select "Contents":<br /><a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/Members/alexander.jones-40nyu.edu/folder_contents">http://isaw.nyu.edu/Members/alexander.jones-40nyu.edu/folder_contents<br /></a></p>

<p>Select CHAMA and then press the "Change State" button, at which point you'll see these options:</p>

<p><br />From here you'd select "Include contained items" and Change State. Since this has already been published everything in Chama is currently publically available. If the items were not in a folder you'd have to specify each one but using the contents list allows you to easily select at that point.</p>
