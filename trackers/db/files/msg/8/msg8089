<p>Thanks Kate, can you leave it in the lecture hall. Anshul, I don't believe there is anything that will need to be special here and to my knowledge Skype is already installed but tomorrow we will go over this just to make sure.</p>
<p><em><br />I won't be in tomorrow, but I can leave the laptop we would use for that available in the lecture hall if there is any configuration that needs to be done. Otherwise I'll be back in on Tuesday next week.</em></p>
