<p>This is because of ticket 1167. The problem is that I need to update the feature portlet so links can be managed here. When I initially wrote the portlet code this wasn't in the specification. Unfortunately I simply do not have time to do much of any programming here and this has been a feature request since May 26, 2011. Maybe I can fit it in next week but I've reserved that for Kate and the events module, she's been asking for changes there since last year as well.<br /><br />Maybe the week after that or early to mid March, in the interim I'll just override and update this manually.</p>
