<p>Tom,</p>
<p>I have been working with Alex this morning to submit a news item on his <br />work. I noticed that these directions were only sent to Cabinet. Is <br />there an authorship limitation or were these sent to the faculty and <br />others as well? I'm not seeing it in my Mail. I forwarded these <br />directions to him and I then realized he may not be able to see them (?)</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Diane</p>

This seems to have arisen after a recent move <br />&gt; of the item.
