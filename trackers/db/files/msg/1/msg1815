Kate:

I've done these and you can check them via links on the following page (you may need to click &quot;refresh&quot; or &quot;reload&quot; to see the latest version):

If you think they're OK, let me know and I'll go ahead and publish them. We can add the image for the Bo lecture later when you've got it.

Best,
Tom
