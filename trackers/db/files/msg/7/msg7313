<p>The computer store doesn't have it in yet and the pricing also hasn't been updated, they say a week or so. If it's more expensive via the NYU license we'll have to find a way to bypass that if possible. Unless for some reason there is some valid explanation as to paying more for it? I'll leave that decision to Tom but in the meantime we wait.. I'll update soon as it becomes available.</p>
