<p>NYU has a special deal with Autodesk that will allow you to purchase a 13-month license of AUTOCAD (full details in attachment to ticket) for only $150. It would run out in September of next year, at which time you could purchase another. The only restriction is that you can only run it on one NYU-owned machine. The alternative is to buy a permanent one-seat license for $1,395. It would never run out, but of course does not include updates etc.</p>
<p>If you would like to pursue one or the other of these approaches, please confirm which one and what account you would like to use for the purchase (e.g., your research account).</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
