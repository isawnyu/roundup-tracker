My computer is running out of memory & its battery is malfunctioning, so I'd like to discuss the possibility of fixing it vs. buying another one (given that I didn't purchase a computer when I started at ISAW and this was an offer).  I am usually available on Tuesdays or Thursdays or else on MWF afternoons.  Thanks
