<p>The secure data recovery people have gotten back to me and have noted that they will allow us the option of longer turnaround time if we want to lower the price quote. Of course, i'm not sure how long that turn around would be but they'd like a target price on reocvery. I'm of the mindset that negotiating no more than $1,100 USD would be useful. Where we enter neogtiation at the $600 dollar level. If you still do want this data back let me know and we'll take it from there.</p>
