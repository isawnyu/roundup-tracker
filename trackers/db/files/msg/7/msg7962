<p>The machine goes into a deep sleep mode if left on, which is what it should do when you are inactive for a certain period of time. There is no cause for alarm here, the machine will also take a minute or two to fully repower itself to it's operating norm. During this time you should not power down the machine or reboot it as it will begin to cause data incosistency. This is a normal computer paradigm in sleep/waking of the machine. You should go ahead and fully shut the machine down properly and then restart it. Once that's done it should be fine.</p>
