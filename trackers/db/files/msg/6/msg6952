<p>After talking with Irene she reminded me that the main feature portlet on the front page needs an override for Exhibitions featured prominently on the front page as well. I'll update this when I actually have some useful mockups to show. I believe the rationale was along the lines of Roger being able to manage that little bit of area or some such. However this was an issue that was never resolved most likely due to other pressing concerns at the time. &nbsp;I am of the belief that this work will align nicely with the proposed Exhibitions image widget and still work in a manner that is conducive with exposing Exhibitions and related artifacts as well as staying staid in promoting featured events and lectures. It is also space that is ripe for exposing and dogfooding related Pleaides functionality. So, for instance, the map(s) associated with an Exhibition could be displayed using a Pleaides widget etc.</p>
