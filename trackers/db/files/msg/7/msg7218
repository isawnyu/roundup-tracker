<p>This has taken much longer than expected. Initially on prep for transport I took a look at the HD serial number of the drive which shouldn't have been affected by the plague of HD's that were on prepare for crash. Decided to zero out the drive ahead of time to see if we get any badblocks. The good news is that there were few bad blocks for the HD size but a large amount of fragmentation for this drive, this would explain the noise. I attribute this to all the data moving around during that tumultuous period when Diane got the machine. The bad news is that time machine decided it was a great time to do a cleanup of it's backup system at the same time. This took a couple of hours to complete, thus missing my appointment unfortunately as I would have liked to have the machine reviewed. In any event, when done it was time to restore the system but it going to take roughly 6 hours. Of which I won't be here to monitor; as I have other responsiblities to tend to rather urgently. It's highly likely, i'm going to have to be here early tomorrow AM to make sure everything went well and we'll restore from there. At which point I must leave ISAW immediately but I suspect everything should be ok. I'll follow up with Diane afterwards.</p>
<p>It's in my hopes this alleviates a lot of the obvious slowness and digusting noise. A graph of the hd fragmentation shows a much better alignment of the small amount of data on there and it sounds better already. I'm going to wait until everything is restored before hand but the machine should still be sent to Apple regardless of any of the above.</p>
