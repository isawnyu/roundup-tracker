Michael,
I would like to purchase a MacBook Air from my startup funds, if possible in time for a trip I have to make next week (hence the "high priority"--not an emergency but a bit of a hurry). Tiffany tells me that you can help with filling out a form for the NYU store so it can be billed to ISAW directly. It might be best for timing if it was possible to arrange for me to pick up the laptop downtown instead of having it delivered here, presuming they have it in stock.

The model I want to get is the 2.13GHz MacBook Air with solid-state drive. I'd also want to have the external USB "SuperDrive".

The one item of software that I'd like to have on it ASAP is Office Mac 2004; do we have a site licence for that? If not, I can probably take care of it myself.
