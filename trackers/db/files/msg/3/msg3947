I've gone ahead and pushed information about the Emberling and Freed lectures to the main ISAW website:

http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/events/emberling-2011-03-24.htm

and

http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/events/freed-2011-04-14.htm

Please let me know if you need anything changed. Once we have an abstract for the other event, we can do that one too.

Best,
Tom
