I was trying to find ISAW's listing in the index of NYU's centers and institutes at
http://www.nyu.edu/academics/centers-and-institutes.html

We aren't in the list. After a bit I realized that the right side of the page has feature listings for ISAW, Courant, IFA, and Poly, and I guess someone in the design dept thought that if we were there, we didn't need to be in the big list. This is a bad idea though, since people looking for a particular institute are going to zero in on the links list, and probably won't even notice the other stuff on the page.

I don't see that the designers of the new NYU site have provided any contact for reporting problems either!
