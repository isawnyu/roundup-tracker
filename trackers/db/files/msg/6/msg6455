<p>Hi, John B. here:&nbsp; I am working from Mike's computer on the ticket system. There are two problems.&nbsp; The first is that there seems to be no text "wrapping" on the messages and they run much wider than the screen.&nbsp; I tried reducing the zoom to BELOW 100%, but even that doesn't get the full message on the screen and there does not seem to be a way for the user to cursor over the text and scroll right.&nbsp; How can we read the entire message when it is a long one?</p>
<p>Also, when looking at the trail of messages for a specific ticket the date does not display (or I am not seeing it).&nbsp; Is there a way to make the date of the messages appear in the history?&nbsp; It makes it hard to see which items need an updated response without the date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
