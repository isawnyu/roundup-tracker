The ants in the 2nd floor kitchen are much worse this morning (4/11).  Desiree had to rewash the coffee urns (which were clean when she left Friday) because they were all over them, as well as the rolling cart.  Do we have any spray or ant traps we could use between exterminator visits, or is there some way we can seal off the window where they are getting in?
