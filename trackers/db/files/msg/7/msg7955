<p>&gt; Hi Christopher,<br />&gt; I am working on the order you submitted to arrange for telephone, <br />&gt; voice mail and long distance access for Robert Hayland.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; All the programming work should be done by tomorrow and I will email <br />&gt; to him directly information about setting up voice mail and his LD <br />&gt; authorization code.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; For the tech to come up and install the phone, the earliest date <br />&gt; possible right now is Friday 9/14.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Our process has been to agree on a day that works for you all (and the <br />&gt; guard knows the tech is coming and the tech will be able to get into <br />&gt; the room and do the installation without trouble) - is 9/14 Ok or do <br />&gt; you want to do a different day?<br />&gt;<br />&gt; I think I can hold this day until EOB tomorrow, but it might be pushed <br />&gt; out further if I can't get the order to the techs by then!<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Thanks!<br />&gt;<br />&gt; -- <br />&gt; Linda Greenshields<br />&gt; Senior Communications Analyst<br />&gt; ITS Communications and Computing Services<br />&gt; New York University<br />&gt; (212) 998-1368 &lt;tel:%28212%29%20998-1368&gt;<br />&gt; linda.greenshields@nyu.edu &lt;mailto:linda.greenshields@nyu.edu&gt;<br />&gt; */to request a service, please go to:<br />&gt; /*http://www.nyu.edu/its/forms/communications_form.pdf</p>
