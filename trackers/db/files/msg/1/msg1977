Hi Mike,

Lillian Tseng, the new faculty member who will be taking room 500 as her office, is coming for a visit in the next few weeks.  Can you please have room 500 cleaned, and have a duplicate of the key to that room made for her?  

This should be done by next Thursday or Friday if possible, as she will be here early the following week.

Thanks,
Whitney
