<p>I've just rediscovered this old ticket. I assume that the purchase of SPSS licensing to go on the "archaeological workstation" is now going to meet this need. If that's incorrect and you want to purchase a license to have it on your office machine, please let me know by appending to this ticket. Otherwise, I'll close it out.</p>
