<p>I can't add the dates that the exhibition is closed on the website. Is it possible to give me access to edit the "Learn More" box on the right of the screen or can&nbsp; you add the following under the hours?<br /><br />Exhibition closed: Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New Years Day.<br />No free guided tour&nbsp; Friday December 23 and Friday December 30th.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Irene</p>
