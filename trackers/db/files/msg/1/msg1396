Dear Mike,

The exhibitions department is hosting a reception on Wednesday, December 3, 6-8 pm in the Oak Library.  We kindly ask that all the furniture, except the 2 large couches, 2 large tables and 2 cabinets be removed. Please leave the large table in the middle of the room just as it normally is. I am available if you would like to discuss the details.

Thank you,
Irene
