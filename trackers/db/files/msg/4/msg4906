Unfortunately there is but so much I can do here sans championing it myself. At best i'd be able to forward this downtown but if the account is failing to merge for the nyu.edu address this is something that would have to be escalated via downtown.

All that stated, migration is still not finished so I don't want to report or cause anymore confusion that what is already going on. If this is still an issue tomorrow just update and i'll get on it asap.
