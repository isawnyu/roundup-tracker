<p>Rohan reinstalled iPhoto yesterday and it was working fine. This morning every action in Word and Mail hung up the machine (pinwheel of infinity), so I quit all my apps and restarted the machine, which has just come back up.</p>
<p>iPhoto "cannot be opened because of a problem" came up. Says to check with the developer to make sure iPhoto works with this version of Mac OS X. You may need to reinstall the applicaiton."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday I reviewed the photos in iPhoto and do not need any of them immediately, but would be helpful to have iPhoto working on a 1-2 week horizon. Thanks, Diane</p>
