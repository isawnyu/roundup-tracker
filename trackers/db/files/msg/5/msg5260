Hi Irene:

Christopher's looked at Jennifer's machine and concluded that a big chunk of her problems are due to its not having enough memory. We think we can fix that by ordering a ~$70 memory upgrade. Since this is an exhibition machine, I'm under direction from Roger to bill it to exhibitions, so I need to ask for a chartfield to use so we can get this on order.

Thanks,
Tom
