<p>Throwing to testing.. &nbsp;it looks like varnish couldn't read from blobstorage which actually has me quite concerned. However it looks to be working after a restart and upgrade of some of the client settings. Due to the nature of this i'm going to throw a zeoclient on pipsqueak.atlantides.org and possibly automaton.isaw.nyu.edu for some better redundancy. I'll open a new ticket for that but in the meantime i'll try to keep an eye on it.</p>
