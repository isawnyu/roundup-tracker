Hi Chris,

I cannot close down my computer anymore because I tried to open a link and got stuck. Also from tomorrow on i'll be in France. If you could find a moment to do some updates on my computer during my absence that would be great. Please take care of everything only from tomorrow onward because I am in  a hectic today and need to get things done before I leave.
Thanks a lot, as always your help is much appreciated.
All best,
Beate
