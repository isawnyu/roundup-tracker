<p>Irene:</p>
<p>I want to make sure you understand the license terms here. Please forgive me if you had this discussion already, but I see no evidence of that here in the ticket history so I have to err on the side of caution. The Annual Volume License program that Christopher found for $59.67 per seat is a true annual cost. At the end of the year, you would have to do one of the three following things:</p>
<p>(1) uninstall the software</p>
<p>(2) pay another annual fee of $59.67 (or more if they raise the price) for each copy you want to keep using</p>
<p>(3) convert to a different licensing model</p>
<p>During each year of the subscription you would be eligible for all software updates, etc. at no additional costs.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable with an annual subscription license on this model, please let me know and I will talk to purchasing about how to get a PO approved.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p>
