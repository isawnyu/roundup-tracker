<p>Water started pouring out of the ceiling again, somewhat spontaneously. Dwayne has come and cleaned up and we've put a fresh bucket under, but the water damage is clearly spreading in the sheetrock and the nearby sconce is not working (not sure if it is related).</p>
<p>- Paul came by and has been informed.</p>
<p>- The HVAC units on 6 in Alexander and Irene's office have been turned off and the temp in the IT office has been turned up slightly, but we cannot turn them off due to the server in that office and close to 100 degree temp forecast over the weekend.</p>
<p>Paul is&nbsp;committed to visiting on Sat.</p>
