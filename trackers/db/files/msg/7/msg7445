<p>The upper floors of the building are very uncomfortable -- very hot and humid. For the last few weeks my office (601) has regularly reached 86 degreesin the afternoon, and humidity is parked at over 75%. &nbsp;This has been an issue for quite some time, for me personally, my computer, and the library books on my shelves. Please switch on the a/c switch sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p>
