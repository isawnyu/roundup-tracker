Michael,

I realized this morning that I made a typo in Randolph Ford's netID -- it is rbf243, not rvf243.  It's right in the list serve, but not on the list of copier codes you sent me (which I think you made using the list I made the typo on).  Can you please double check that you have it right in the system when you have a chance?

Thanks,
Whitney
