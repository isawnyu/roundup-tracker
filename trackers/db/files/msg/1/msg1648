Dear Mike,

The exhibitions department is hosting a lecture followed by a reception on April 2. The lecture will be in the Lecture hall 5-6 PM and the reception will be in the Oak Library 6-7 PM. Could we please have the lecture hall filled to capacity with chairs. I think that this lecture is going to be very well attended so we will a few additional chairs available that we can set up right outside the Lecture Hall. Dwayne helped us with this for one of our past events. Is he available to stay on April 2 to help? No furniture needs to be removed from the Oak Library.

Thank you,
Irene
