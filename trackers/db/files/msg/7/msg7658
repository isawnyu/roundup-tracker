<p>Dear Tom and Chris,<br />I hope your Summer is going well.<br />I am currently abroad and have brought my Dell laptop with me. As I<br />told you a few days before leaving New York, the new computer has<br />started giving me the same kind of problems as the old one. The laptop<br />recognizes any pen drive, but most of the time I can not save files<br />that are bigger than a few Kb. Once in a while, the process of<br />transferring files goes through and I can open them using my computer,<br />but somehow these files are not recognized by other machines. When I<br />was at the DOP conference in the Netherlands a couple of weeks ago<br />with Roger, I brought with me a pen drive with the PowerPoint I saved<br />using my Dell. However, the computer used at the conference venue did<br />not find any of the files (it was not a matter of different operating<br />systems or different versions of the same systems). Fortunately, I had<br />saved the PowerPoint on a cd and used that for my presentation.<br />However, this was a real problem and it will continue causing problems<br />(I constantly need to transfer files from different pen drives when I<br />am doing work in Egypt and also when teaching downtown).<br />I agree that this issue has caused a lot of stress and loss of time to<br />all of us and I am asking you for your advice. Do you know when the<br />warranty expires for the Dell laptop? Frankly, if it is possible, I<br />would rather get a different model than have to go through weeks of<br />having Dell representatives changing parts of the laptop and then<br />having the same issues resurfacing again. If it is a possibility, at<br />this point I am also fine with a Mac (Chris, I know you are thinking<br />"I told you so"!!!) if we can get the money back from Dell. Of course,<br />these are just some thoughts, as I am not aware how things would work<br />in this particular case. I just would like to get to a point where I<br />don't have to constantly worry about fixing my computer...<br />Many thanks and have a great Summer!<br />Nicola</p>
