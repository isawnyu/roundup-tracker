Michael, if you can come by on Monday or whenever you're in next week to discuss logistics for the Lod Mosaic roundtable on Sat. Oct. 2nd, that would be great. We have 5 speakers who will each give individual presentation and then have a group question period at the end I need to figure out the microphone situation.
Thanks, Kate
