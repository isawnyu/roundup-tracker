<p>My home machine has OS X 6, and I imagine my laptop does too, unless you've changed it. I gather that this is no longer current and doesn't support iCloud. Should these be updated to X 7? And if so, is that something that has to be ordered? When I told my home machine to update, it updated to a newer version of X 6.</p>
