<p>I sent the following inquiry to Scott Jackson today (he's NYU's licensed software purchasing officer):</p>
<p>Hi Scott: <br /> <br />We have a faculty member who is interested in seeing if he can get a copy of a piece of software named "VG Studio Max" from a company called Volume Graphics: <br /> <br /><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.volumegraphics.com/en/products/vgstudio-max.html">http://www.volumegraphics.com/en/products/vgstudio-max.html</a> <br /> <br />Do you know if there have been any past or current licensing arrangements with them? <br /> <br />Thanks, <br />Tom&nbsp;</p>
