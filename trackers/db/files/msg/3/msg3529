Kathy would like to have the meat slicer (which is currently on the windowsill in the first floor kitchen) back in the basement so she can prepare sandwich meats. The slicer is quite heavy, so this is a two person job.  We also need to get this done by next Monday at the latest, so it is out of the way before the exhibition staff begins using the first floor kitchen. 

If the slicer is moved when Kathy is not here, she has asked that it be put on the small table between the refrigerator units.

Thanks,
Whitney
