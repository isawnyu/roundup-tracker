Chris, 
I said I would try to keep track of my internet windows when I leave at night/arrive in the morning. Here's the latest:
I had no internet sessions open when I left last yesterday. 
I opened Safari when I first arrived and it came to my NYU Home, as it is set. I closed the window.
Now I have opened Safari a 2nd time, over an hour later, and am getting the Java page I showed you yesterday, showing the session has timed out.
