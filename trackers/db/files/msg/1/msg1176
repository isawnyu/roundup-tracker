Alex,

I have faxed over the purchase request.  Typically, we would also purchase AppleCare for these machines.  We have the option to add AppleCare to your machine for 1 year.  The cost is something like $186.  I won't add it on until we have the chance to discuss it and get approval to add it to your budget.

Best,
Michael
