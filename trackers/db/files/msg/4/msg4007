When I came in this morning, one of the shades in the lecture hall had fallen down and was lying on the ground (one of the sun shades, not the black out shades). If someone can take a look at it and determine whether it just needs to be hung back up or replaced, that would be great.  If it can't be fixed quickly we should find someplace where we can store the shade since there are lectures planned for Monday and Tuesday next week.
