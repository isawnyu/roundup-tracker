I do have a Skype account, which I set up so I could talk to my mother from Egypt, but she didn't get it installed, and I never used it. So I have forgotten my ID and password. 

Would my desktop not support Skype? Ah yes, I don't have speakers attached to it. Sound on the Macbook Air is not supposed to be great, so it might be better to use an ISAW laptop with better speakers.
