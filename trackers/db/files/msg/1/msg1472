Dear Mike,

On January 20th the musicians that are performing here on January 22nd will have a rehearsal in the Lecture Hall from 6-8 PM. No furniture needs to be removed at this time however this will give us an understanding of how much room they need to perform on the 22nd. They are bringing all their own equipment. I hope it is ok that I will be creating another building ticket on January 21 with all the details for the concert on the 22nd. I do not anticipate much of the change with the current setup; we may just have to remove a couple rows in the front.

As always please call me if you would like to review in person.

Thanks,
Irene
