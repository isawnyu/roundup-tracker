<p>Just received the following email from Meredith Rendall at ITS:</p>
<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'm confirming distribution with the computer store. &nbsp;Once I have that, I'll let you know. &nbsp;That means you can purchase it through them the way you would with any other software.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If that doesn't work out, I'll require chartfields to complete the transaction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Either way, I'll let you know.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Meredith</div>
