<p>Irene is having excel formatting problems such that when she opens the excel spreadsheet the formatting is destroyed. This is simply an office issue, so 2008 and 2010/11 use different formatting routines. This ticket is here because it'll most likely occur elsewhere, there is very little to be done. The work around is to create a fresh excel spreadsheet in 2010/11 and migrate all the data to the new spreadsheet format.</p>
