Cleared some of these up. Changed hostnames and mac addresses for many of the machines on the 6th, 5th and 4th floors to the correct setup as they are now. Will step through all of the ips to ensure they are actually in use or if the person has left isaw making sure they are retired.

Need a system of some sort for this.
