I flipped on the heater in the 3rd floor reception area this morning and it was not warm -- I let it run for 45 minutes and it will still not heat up no matter what I adjust the thermostat to.  It was working fine when I turned it off yesterday evening.  If someone could please come look at this as soon as possible -- it is very chilly at my desk.

Thanks,
Whitney
