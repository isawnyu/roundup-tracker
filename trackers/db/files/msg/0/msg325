Hi Darren:

I'm writing with regard to copiers that are currently leased by the ISAW division by NYU. We currently lease the following:

Lanier LD345 $392.00 per month
Lanier LD275 $799.00 per month
Supply Contract (Toner, Develop., etc) $129.00

Total $1320.00 per month
Total $15840.00 per year

We'd really need quotes on the following:

a.) less expensive monochrome copiers for lease;
ideally, we would like copiers that can sort, staple, scan -- within a 60 pp minute capacity.

b.) We're also willing to purchase copiers but we need you to please
provide us with information on the maintenance costs associated with purchase of these monochrome copiers.

Please feel free to call me to discuss this further.

Many thanks,
Suzan
