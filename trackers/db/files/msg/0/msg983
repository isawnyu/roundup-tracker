Tim-

When you have a moment, could you kindly update the online staff directory, replacing Anna's name with Kate and the title: Academic Programs Coordinator.
I've updated as much as I can on the Wiki for the VRS, but I don't know the new carrels or extensions for the librarians. Do they have new extensions?

Thank you.
