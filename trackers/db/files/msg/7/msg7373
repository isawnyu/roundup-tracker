<p>An appointment has been set for 3:15pm, Rohan is going to take the machine over there and express how much it is needed back here. In the meantime he's going to set Diane up on another machine.. If we can get the machine back today then fine, if we cannot get the machine back today i'll be cc'd and will have to determine when I can pick it up. I didn't necessarily plan to be out of town but maybe i'll leave my car on the Upper West Side and go pick it up when it's ready. We'd like to have this done before Monday but the schedule will be based on Apple.</p>
