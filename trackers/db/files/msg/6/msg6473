<p>Yes that's ok it doesn't mean that there isn't a sharing problem on Tom's side. I won't normally get this in-depth into technical explanation and I don't state this in a condescending tone&nbsp;but I will this time for the sake of your curiosity. <br /><br />Most computer systems operate on a server/client model and as this is the web almost all communication is done via this method. The client, is a web browser (Safari, Firefox, Chrome) and the server is a web server (Apache, Nginx, Anything that adheres to the HTTP protocol). &nbsp;HTTP (HyperTextTransferProtocol) is a stateless protocol, a stateless protocol means that every request the server receives operates as a single and unrelated request to the previous one. HTTP operates over the transmission control protocol which ensures your request actually reaches the server so that it then may respond. Each protocol stated, encases and is layered in the one before it. Like an onion, when the request is complete on the client end it's wrapped in this onion of protocol information and is sent over the Internet to be peeled on the server side, layer by layer.</p>
<p>Google uses the iCalendar protocol which operates over HTTP it's extended with our own little bit of Googlyness in some cases, specifically for mobile and other systems. However, because all of the protocol request are not tracked and due to the way distributed systems work. Sometimes things get out of sync, the "Transmission Control Protocol" or the TCP part of TCP/IP normally keeps things in check for transport but that's not the case for stateless protocols. This normally means that checksum (literally checking the sum) of the bytes traveling over the line is needed or some other method of making sure we get information correctly. Or validation of data is done somehow.</p>
<p>Sometimes this doesn't work, for instance, if you are streaming a youtube video normally many "packets" are dropped. Normally a very small amount that you don't even notice anything wrong with the video. Other times that's not the case and everything looks garbled, because so many bytes of information are missing. However, sometimes this happens over the wire and sometimes it's for a configuration variable. Like "Share my calendar with this person", so it's possible it worked and then something got messed up somewhere and it just needs an explicit reset.</p>
<p>It's also possible iCal has old data that it's requesting be sent but the server is saying "No, I'm not allowed to send any updated data" or some such.</p>
<p>It's also possible that some data value somewhere just needs to be reset.</p>
<p>We can't really know because we aren't watching exactly what is happening as it goes over the wire and we don't have the explicit ability to monitor both sides client and server in any easy fashion.</p>
<p>This is why we ask Tom to check his sharing settings so that we can be sure that we aren't having any problems on the server side. Then, we can proceed to check your iCal client and see if we need to flush any cache or rebuild etc etc. Of course we have to be rational and make sure we don't try to do the same thing over and over expecting a different outcome. So we have to step through the problem and think about the best way to remedy it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, when Tom checks his sharing settings and we can rule out any problems on the server side. Then we can follow up and check your client. Same thing goes for Mobile Me. Once you check with Apple to make sure that your account with them is working we can proceed to make sure the client works. Or at least provide them with actual data so that we may fix the problem.</p>
<p>If you would like I can go further into detail later.</p>
