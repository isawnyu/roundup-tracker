<p>Chris, If you can provide two things, I think I can help improve this situation:</p>
<p>1. Any of the stuff I donated, if not useful, give me. There's no need to keep 3 boxes of stuff in your office endlessly. I think I have a place we can safely store it and keep available, if useful. If you want to identify needless junk, we can dispose of completely.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Give me a list of what holes or desk changes you need and I will work on this. The vendor will be doing some work in the building soon and I might be able to add to the list of what they do while on property - they will have to evaluate the request first. To take this forward, I need this list by 2/27.</p>
<p>Thanks, Diane</p>
