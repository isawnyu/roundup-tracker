<p>Most of the problems relating to Jennifer tend to be because of the jennifer.chi1@nyu.edu alias. Also, I try not to bother Jennifer because some of the changes that need to be made will interrupt her workflow; for instance. Right now there are 3 software updates that must take place on her machine. One for safari, one for the actual display of the computer and I believe one for iTunes which isn't that critical.<br /><br />There are numerous other issues that are more systemic for instance sign-on problems, printer problems etc. For most of these problems I have work arounds and/or open tickets that are in a deferred status. For instance, employee onboarding has been spec'd in the form of register.isaw.nyu.edu which would allow for easy onboarding. Single sign-on has been in deferred status as well, etc etc.</p>
<p>It is in my hopes that soon Jennifer will feel to be apart of the herd and I will do my best to make it so etc etc.</p>
