<p>I spoke with Dawn about this and will head over to the Met sometime this week to see how their scanner operates and what the differences are. What i'll then do is literally copy the exact functionality to the scanner that we have here. Unless for some reason the hardware/software is different which I don't expect. We'll have the same exact configuration as the Met, to which this scanner problem should be put to bed in regards to functionality.</p>
<p>I'll vet the configuration back at ISAW and at my downtown office, if for some reason we are having functional problems after that we'll decide on next steps from there.</p>
