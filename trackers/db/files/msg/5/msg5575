<pre>Tom,

I wish I'd known before our meeting this morning, but we now have a W-9 form that must be filled out for ALL US companies we pay. This form can be scanned and stored and used repeatedly.  I want to set up a (new) folder that key staff that initiate payments can access. That way if 2 different teams are paying the same vendor, we can store 1 copy. Irene, Dawn, Whitney, Kate, myself, Tiffany, Chuck, you and Chris, Elizabeth, maybe Roger, maybe Julienne, should all have access to it, and maybe others.

This is for an Accounts Payable function, W-9 forms. 

Thoughts?
