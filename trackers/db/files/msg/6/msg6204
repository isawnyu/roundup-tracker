<p>No one should be using the computer Nate uses to print, ever, I've told Alan this before. I've repaired the other library terminal. There is also another library terminal available for use and the 6th floor printer is available otherwise. The issue tracker is bookmarked on both library terminals and I can access the issue tracker fine from both terminals.</p>
