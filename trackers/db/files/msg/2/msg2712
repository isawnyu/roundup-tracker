Gentlemen, 

Julienne's laptop experienced a OS failure this afternoon while I tried to solve a printer driver problem she was having after updating.

Julienne is using the Exhibitions Macbook, without a full backup or partial backup of her most recent files.  (Her Macbook Pro only recently had its new MAC address added to the whitelist, and Time Machine was not set up).

The laptop is currently connected to an iMac in our office.  I am running Disk Warrior to attempt to save the data.  It does not appear as if it may finish before I leave for the day.

As soon as possible, I need Chris to get as far as he can with the following steps.  I will not return to ISAW until next Thursday, since I'm headed to the Leon Levy Foundation on Monday.
1) Verify Disk Warrior completed successfully
2) If so, migrate Julienne's user account to the iMac its connected to using the migration assistant
3) Verify the hard drive
4) Format and repartition the hard drive
5) Reinstall OS X
6) Migrate Julienne's account back to her laptop

Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Best,
Michael
