<p>Jans' was already onboarded into our Systems September 4th 2012. At the time his netid was not onboarded and Kate sent him the requisite information, the problems we are currently experiencing have to do with the fact that NYU infrastructure seems to be failing repeatedly. Single Sign-On, Wireless, etc, etc. There is nothing that I can currently do about this unfortunately.</p>
<p>The only thing left to be done is printer setup but i'd like to wait to see if the connection he currently has is stable and we'll go from there. Also we should probably stop supporting Windows XP as a general rule. The technology is simply too old, Microsoft has released about 4 full operating systems since 2001. Making XP approximately 10 years old.</p>
