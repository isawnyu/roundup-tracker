<p>May I suggest we go a bit further, to wit (we can do nos. 1 and 2 immediately):</p>
<p>1. Enable Macintosh built-in polytonic Greek keyboard entry (see instructions at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biblicalgreek.org/links/fonts/keyboard.php#Installation">http://www.biblicalgreek.org/links/fonts/keyboard.php#Installation</a>&nbsp;under the subheading "Mac Lion &amp; Snow Leopard")</p>
<p>2. Install the following free Unicode Greek fonts:&nbsp;<a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=Gentium">Gentium and Gentium Plus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://apagreekkeys.org/NAUdownload.html">New Athena Unicode version 4.05</a>.</p>
<p>3. I will purchase a license for Greek Keys 2008 (a long-standing to-do in any case) and will then update this ticket with installation details for the IT team.</p>
<p>I'm leaving this unassigned for the moment, but copying Anshul and Monish so one or the other can pick this up. Copying Kate since she is a close friend of the laptop in question. T</p>
