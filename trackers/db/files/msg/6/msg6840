<p>Diane,&nbsp; (John here)&nbsp; Garfield and Paul and I can handle these minor issues even when Mike is not around.&nbsp; As I am sure you know MOST "alarms" are not critical and do not signal the fire department.&nbsp; This is one of those cases.&nbsp; I think it is best if we let the system play out as it is designed.&nbsp; There is no reason for you to trouble yourself by getting involved in these minor issues or repairs.&nbsp; We will certainly keep you in the loop if there is anything that really has an impact on the safety or security of the building and the people in the building.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
