My laptop crashed on Friday and I had to format it in order to fix it. Therefore, I lost the copy of File Maker you installed for me. since I am still working from home, I was wondering if you could install it again. I will be at ISAW on Thursday. Can I stop by your office then? At what time?
Thank you
Roberta
