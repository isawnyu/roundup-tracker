Hi Tom, please add the following copy to Roger's Spring semester class, please replace the old title with the new one. Also, please add 'II' on the end of Beate's title for the Spring, as it will be a continuation of the Fall semester course. Thirdly, please remove Jennifer's course for now, it is still not clear whether or not she will be offering one.

Thanks, Kate


Archaeology and Texts:  Complementary, Redundant, and Contradictory

This seminar will address the issues involved in using multiple kinds of evidence for the investigation of problems in the study of the ancient world. It is organized around case studies that each participant will contribute to the discussion. The first half of the seminar will discuss such topics as the value of myth in third millennium Mesopotamia in interpreting the contemporary archaeological record and the reconstruction of imperial structure through the analysis of textual and visual lists. Participants will be expected to present topics of problems of archaeology and text within their own fields of interest.
