Hi Michael,

The problem I thought I was having with my battery has escalated.  I could not start the machine this AM, even with the power cord plugged in.  The battery was completely flat, and took ca. 3 hrs to charge.  It now seems to be fully charged, but the machine still does not start.

I'm workin on the Dell mini.
