<p>Roger's office should have been cleaned last week as part of the 3rd floor cleaning, but the floors have clearly not been swept in a very long time and some of his furniture is quite dusty. Please coordinate with me when we can move the furniture and do a thorough dusting of his room when he is out of the office.&nbsp;</p>
