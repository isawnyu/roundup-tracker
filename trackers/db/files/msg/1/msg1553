Dear Mike,

The exhibitions department will be showing a film in the lecture hall on February 18th starting at 7 PM. Could we please have as many chairs possible in the lecture hall that will still allow the doors to close.

As always let me know if you would like to speak in person about this event.

Thanks,
Irene
