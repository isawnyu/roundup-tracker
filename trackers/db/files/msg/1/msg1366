Hi Michael:

Somehow I didn't figure out that I would need to upgrade parallels from 3.0 when I went to snow leopard. I need it in order to access financial reports (brio) and also some legacy microsoft access applications. 

Can you get me an appropriate parallels disk image? Is there anything we need to do about licensing costs?

Thanks,
Tom
