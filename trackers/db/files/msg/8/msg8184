<p>I havent yet logged into my account, so am using Diane's. Please could you address the following matters:</p>
<p>1. I need a code for the 4th floor photocopier (it is not the last 4 digits of my phone number)</p>
<p>2. both word and adobe have authentication problems on my pc (if you open a word doc a failure to authenticate message pops up and if you open a pdf it keeps requesting you to agree to the terms/conditions).</p>
<p>Thanks, Robert Hoyland.</p>
