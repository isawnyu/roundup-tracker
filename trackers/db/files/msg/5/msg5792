<p>Although my key can lock the cabinets above my desk, it does not lock the drawer. It turns fine with the key but the internal mechanism does not actually lock anything. Right now I can keep my computer in the cabinet, but soon this will be booked filled, so it would be great to have the drawer lock as well.</p>
