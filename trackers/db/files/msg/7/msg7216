<p>Lorenzo needs photoshop installed on his machine; it's blocking other work. This should have been part of the initial purchase/load (in face, the whole Adobe Creative Suite) for faculty, but it looks like I overlooked it. If we need to order media and/or the departmental license they can be found under the "department software licensing" menu choice, then "Adobe &gt; More Details" . The install we used for Nico was CS 5.5 Design Standard (Win) IIRC. &nbsp;These can be charged to operating. Apologies for the oversight. Tom</p>
