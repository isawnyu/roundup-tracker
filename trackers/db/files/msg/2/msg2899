Roger,

I have recovered bookmarks from at least 6/10/2009.  It will be possible to import bookmarks from other places you may have them.  I am currently using recovery software to locate the more recent discarded file.  Once we have determined that we have restored them to your satisfaction, I recommend that we use the DiskGenie software on the PC to create an additional full backup on your attached LaCie.  It seems to have plenty of available space.
