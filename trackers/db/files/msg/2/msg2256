Hi Beate,

Congrats! There are a couple of ways to modify your email signature depending on what your primary email client is. If you are using the default Mail application you would do the following.

From the Mail application menu at the top select the bolded Mail and then Preferences. From there select Signatures and you should see your signature in that corresponding list. From there you should be able to select the signature for modification and change the text.

These directions are also available here: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61446

If you are using Entourage as your primary mail solution you'll want to load Entourage and select Tools on the top menu and then select Signatures. The signature box will open and you can edit a signature box.

If you have your signature setup through the nyu email system you can navigate to http://home.nyu.edu in the upper right hand will be a link to email. Select that link and then on the top will be a selection for changing Options. Select that and there will be a display of Signature.  You can update your signature there and select Save Changes and you will be all set!

Should you have any questions, don't hesitate.
