Hi Mike/Duane:

I just have two very small requests:

a.) could the area behind the reception desk on 3 be vacuumed? I recently opened a package that had a good deal of packing material; I cleaned most of it myself, but there is still some litter on the carpet.

b.) The refrigerator in the 4th floor kitchen is freezing food and water. Could you check the temperature / perhaps lower the temp, if possible?

As always, many thanks for your help,
Suzan
