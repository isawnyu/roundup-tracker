As discussed with cabinet and approved by the Director, we are implementing a decentralized backup strategy that involves putting an external drive on each staff and faculty member's desk and then (re)configuring backup software to work with that drive. The mass order of drives was submitted yesterday afternoon (iBuy requisition #:062911642905)  and is making its way through the approval chain now. Once these are received, we will announce a schedule for rolling out the new approach across all staff and faculty machines.

As to the functioning of the backup drive on your machine, we are conducting a test with Nico's new laptop. It's running the built-in Windows backup to an external drive that we bought as part of the package. If that behaves well over the next couple of weeks, we will reconfigure your machine to work the same way (getting rid of the third party backup software that's been causing trouble). So expect to see the next update on this issue in the 15-20 July time-frame.
