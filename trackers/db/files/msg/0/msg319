Hi,
For the past week there have been instances of my email not shutting down and I have had to force quit. Today I realized that I have not gotten some emails. I tried the "get mail" button but nothing happened, I tried to shut down and it did not work so I had to force quit again. Upon opening I received half of the emailed I knew I had been sent.
Please help.
Thanks,
Irene
