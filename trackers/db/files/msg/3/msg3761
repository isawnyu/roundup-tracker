Hi,  Roger would like some assistance in building a Mac. He'd like Ben to help him look at Macs and get one built, so to speak, that meets his needs.  I can then go into ibuy and make the purchase.
Can we have this done this afternoon at say, 3pm?  Roger is also available this morning until noon.
Thank you!
