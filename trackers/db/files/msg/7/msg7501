<p>Right so you have approximately 4 banks free and I feel as if we should simply fill these to capacity. We can do one of three things.</p>
<p>1. You currently have 6 GB.. Two 1GB FB-DIMM modules and Two 2GB FB-DIMM modules totaling 6GB and filling 4 slots. The remaining 4 banks can be filled with 4GB FB-DIMM modules. Which would total 16GB of extra memory rounding out to 22GB. To be frank, I don't like the number 22 as the limit but then I don't like the number 6 either. Slight OCD, slight bad octect arithmetic in dealing with memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Stuff the remaining banks with 8GB modules which would give us a total of 38GB of memory. Supply and demand makes 8GB modules very expensive however. 32GB would be rougly $1600 USD versus the 16GB which would be about $600 USD or so.<br /><br />3. Just upgrade to 8GB and that would give you a total of 14GB.. &nbsp;that would be around $300-$400 USD..</p>
<p>Actually we can perform numerous other combinations but I don't think you'll need that much memory and it'll start to become ridiculous. I'm not sure what your usage has been like lately but if you plan on keeping this a while lets say another 3-4 years we should at least go with #1&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll get exact pricing for whatever you choose and get it ordered and installed hopefully sooner than later.</p>
