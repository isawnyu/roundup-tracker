<p>I left the PC open yesterday, but found it off today. Possibly it set automatically on pause. When reasuming the system, the PC was not able to provide me with my profile, and I now work from a temporary one. A system window opened noting the problem with the reassuming of the profile, and I clicked ont he buttom in which Win would work for it.</p>
<p>On the new profile I do not have my data, amd above all my dropbox, which is inconvenient.<br />I have the leptop and a hardisk, so I can do all I have to. But something does work properly, I am afraid.</p>
