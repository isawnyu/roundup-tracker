Hi Michael:

I know I told you all the old stuff in the tech wiki could be trashed -- and if it has, no worries -- but if there's any way you could give me (read-only) access to it for a few hours, I could recover some information that's only contained there that I've just now remembered existed.

Sheepishly,
Tom
