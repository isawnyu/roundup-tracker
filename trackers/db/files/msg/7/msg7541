<p>My understanding is that our aim is to have this set up in August before <br />the start of the year. If Christopher could check out the furniture in <br />Nico's office and make sure that one workplace will in fact be OK, that <br />would be helpful; also to see if any additional data or electrical <br />support has to be added. I assume that the actual getting of the <br />equipment will not take long.</p>
