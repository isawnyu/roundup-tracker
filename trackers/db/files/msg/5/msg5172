We are cleaning out the other coat closet on the third floor (the one nearest the library).  There are a few boxes in the closet that need to be moved elsewhere -- one is a large shredder that is too heavy for me to move on my own (apparently it was broken on delivery but Staples declined to come pick it up), another one appears to contain some kind of wiring.  If we could please move those to either the basement or one of the mezzanines, or find a proper way to dispose of them, that would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
Whitney
