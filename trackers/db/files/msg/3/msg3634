As discussed with cabinet and approved by the Director, we are implementing a decentralized backup strategy that involves putting an external drive on each staff and faculty member's desk and then (re)configuring backup software to work with that drive. The mass order of drives was submitted yesterday afternoon (iBuy requisition #:062911642905) and is making its way through the approval chain now. Once these are received, we will announce a schedule for rolling out the new approach across all staff and faculty machines.
