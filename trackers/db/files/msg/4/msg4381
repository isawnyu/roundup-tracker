ITS currently isn't sure what is plugged into where and that is what this whole expedition seems to be about, however the old switches are coming out and new switches are going in, which is good news. They will be monitoring the network here which is the cause of the extensive downtime in hopes of getting a clear map. Hopefully at its completion we will have a better understanding of our network topology. Or at the very least I will be monitoring the entire netblock here at ISAW while this happens. It's highly likely our cameras will go out for a brief period so we will need security clearly aware and on alert.

Otherwise this is a standard exercise and barring the unforseen acts of man should be harmless. Please let me know if the Friday 22, Saturday 23, Sunday 24 date range is acceptable and I'll proceed.
