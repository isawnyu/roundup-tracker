Dear Michael,

I would like to use my research allowance to purchase an iMac for my home office (see below for specification). The educational price is $2199. My research account will not effective until July 1. Could you work with Tiffany to see if I could receive the computer before July 4th holidays? Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!

Best,

Lillian
