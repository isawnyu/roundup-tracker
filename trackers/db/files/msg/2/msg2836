Oak Library:
Substance is rubbed into the beautiful wood floor, immediately inside the door, next to the rug. We believe it is food from the Exhibitions reception on Thurs night, but should be removed before it is ground into the wood.
Also, the furniture was moved back, but the lamp wiring is wound around the lamps, which looks hideous. Please plug them in as we don't know where the plugs are. Thanks!
