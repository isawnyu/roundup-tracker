It seems we setup thunderbird for the Leon Levy Foundation. Specifically for John and Nina.. Terry Cramer just called and wants to know what we want to do about configuration for the thunderbird email client over there.

I'm going to find some directions to point him to and hopefully he can manage. Otherwise this will have to be handled manually.
