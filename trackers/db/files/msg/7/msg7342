<p>The scanner is not allowing reasonably small files to be sent via email (I couldn't send 12 shades-of-gray, pdf'd images at once, for example, storage limit exceeded). Even sending a 3-image file in black and white takes a long time to process.</p>
<p>Also, the scanner is simply deleting images without user interaction. This happened today and a half-hour's worth of scanning was lost while a user went to get a usb drive to make up for the emailing issue (nobody else approached the scanner in the interim).</p>
