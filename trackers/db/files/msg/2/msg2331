It isn't a transient failure. I know that both John Steele's and Anne Tihon's email addresses have been faiing in exactly this way for months, possibly ever since the listserv was set up last year. (I just have been too distracted before now to bother to do anything about it.) Probably the other addresses have been doing this too, but they don't stick in my memory because I don't know the people.
