When I try to access the ISAW Wiki, the log-in box appears asking for my user name and password. I put in what I assume is my user name and my password but it won't let me in. The user name I used is my net id and my password what I use for nyu.edu. What am I doing wrong? Do I have to set up a separate user name? Many thanks!
