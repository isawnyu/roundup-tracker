Called Lenovo tech support to find out how to get a recovery CD for the Lenovo Thinkpad.  Case number 21RVFRD.  Laptop is under warranty and there is no charge for the cd.

The agent advised that there should be a hidden recovery partition available by hitting F11 when booting the computer.  Neither this nor the ThinkVantage button indicated by the boot process led to this recovery partition.

Calling back tech support to have the recovery cd shipped.
