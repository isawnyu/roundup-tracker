It hasn't changed, your message was posted at 6:16pm GMT or 1:16pm GMT -5 and that is how I am viewing it. There have been no changes and to my knowledge no one has changed anything with the ticket system.

To change your timezone you would perform the following:

1. Click My Account in the upper right hand corner
2. Preferences
3. Select Timezone from this list. New York is -5 GMT.

If you'd like we can setup an appointment to get this taken care of.
