Jennifer,

ITS currently wants to upgrade the switches that we have here at ISAW however it's highly likely the cameras are going to become inoperable. Are there any stipulations in regards to the Nubia exhibition and the security surveillance? The cameras would most likely be out for a lengthy period; close to eight (8) hours and Roger alerted me to the fact that this may indeed run afoul of agreements you may have made.
