<p>Roger requests assistance assessing and reworking the cabling arrangements that resulted from the phone cutover. Among other problems, the way things were cabled he could not move his phone to his conference table, which is a common activity for him (e.g., for cabinet meetings). He's also puzzled as to why his printer is plugged into the network (he doesn't remember it being plugged in that way before). At present, in order to accommodate cabinet meeting today, he's had to unplug his computer, so this is an urgent matter. I've copied Diane on the ticket for continuity if/while Roger is away. Thanks.
