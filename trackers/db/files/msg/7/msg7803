<p>This is not particularly urgent, but at some point the Adobe Acrobat software on the student computer at 3rd floor reception seems to have been either removed or installed incorrectly (there is a folder in the Applications menu but it only holds the Uninstaller).&nbsp; I have installed Reader for the time being, but it would be nice if we could have Acrobat on that computer so that I could have a student worker help me make or adjust forms as necessary.&nbsp; Just wanted to put this in now before I forgot.</p>
