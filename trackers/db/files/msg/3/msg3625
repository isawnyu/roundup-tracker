Christopher:

This is not high-priority, just something to look into before we go live. It may be that I just don't understand the right procedure. I wanted to move this page:

http://isaw.nyu.edu/about/departments/digital-programs/it-support-documents/computer-equipment-and-file-backup

from externally published to internally published, but it now seems to be stuck in "externally visible" no matter what I do.

Thanks,
Tom
