<p>Dear Mike,</p>
<p>I would like to request for the air conditioning on the 6th floor to be turned on. It has been extremely hot and uncomfortable all week and the weather forecasts hot and humid temperatures for the rest of the week. The rest of the building is at least 10 degrees cooler. Your help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Irene</p>
