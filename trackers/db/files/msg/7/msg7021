<p>The horrible annual message from ITS requiring stupid password change has just arrived. With the bifurcation between NYU Home password and Google Apps password, this is now pretty unintelligible, and I'm terrified to do anything that will mess up Thunderbird and my iPhone. If I'm reading the ITS site correctly, these use the Apps pw, not the Home pw. I THINK that I have (against their advice) the same for both at present, but I am not sure what software my iPhone is set up to use to retrieve email, and knowing that seems to be necessary to know what to do. Since this is the first time this password change has come since the move to Google for mail, and since that was traumatic, I am very nervous about this. Would it be worthwhile issuing some advice to users that is more helpful than ITS's?</p>
