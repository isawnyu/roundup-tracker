Here's video of how I did it via local roles. Security settings tend to be organic so it's highly likely the settings will change for groups over time, the need for new groups and modifications to existing groups will be ongoing and this ticket will become useful.

In a more perfect world, I would modify the UI, write documentation and make this easier but that is a project in and of itself.
