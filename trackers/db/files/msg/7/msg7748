<p>Tom,<br />My test seems successful, so I have altered the Monday am calendar item <br />and we can see if this works better. Let's go at least one weekly cycle <br />before closing the ticket.<br />Diane</p>

<p>&gt; Diane Bennett added the comment:<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Tom,<br />&gt;<br />&gt; I was unable to use the google group as a destination (in lieu of <br />&gt; email addresses), so if this will improve the experience, if you can <br />&gt; give me some guidance as to how, I'd be glad to try. The google group <br />&gt; has email addresses in it not tied to a gCal (several personal <br />&gt; gmails), so these all are rejected, by example.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Diane<br />&gt;<br />&gt; ISAW issue tracker<br />&gt; http://ticket.isaw.nyu.edu/help/issue1687</p>
