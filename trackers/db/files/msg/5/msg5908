<p>Well actually in reality vm.kmem_size is unstable. I will not be able to diagnose with this server as it's production. So we'll need to look at the kernel code and possibly wait for a bug report of vm.kmem_size preventing boot on startup. Off the cuff analysis would suggest that allocating and segmenting of the memory so early doesn't leave enough memory to boot. Realistically, no one should be setting these variables without at the least 4 gb's or more.</p>
