<p>Hi&nbsp; John B. Here:&nbsp; Just to keep everyone in the loop.&nbsp; We have several bids from companies to do a more comprehensive repair of the glass seal over both conference rooms. We hope to have the work completed before the cold weather, but there is no guarantee.&nbsp; In the mean time, Mike has made some additional patches which should reduce the leak in the interim.&nbsp; More to come!&nbsp; John</p>
