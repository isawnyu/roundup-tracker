<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>Today, when I tried to use the scanner, clicking on the kic icon from the desktop resulted in nothing (scanning screen didn't load). When I tried to shut down, I got a message that someone was already logged in and they might lose data. I shut down and restarted anyway and the scanner worked fine for me. However, both before and after shut-down/restart, the monitor was not working. I tried turning that off and back on but still only got a black screen.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Jessie</p>
