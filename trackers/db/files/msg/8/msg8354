<p>I have lost a month's worth of emails (Sept 21 - Oct 21) from the Mail client. I have no idea what precipitated this. I have a ticket in to ITS, but my experience is that the client is not their concern.</p>
<p>I found these emails in a "recovered" folder yesterday afternoon and I was moving them into my Inbox and left for the day (approx. 170 emails, so it took some time). When I came in this morning, none were in the 'recovered' folder, but also not in my Inbox. Even the few that I stayed to watch the process commence are gone today.</p>
<p>I have gone through all the folders in my Mail client, but do not find them &nbsp;and there are several that are urgent. I can copy all of these from my Gmail copy, but I'm wondering if there's a way to identify them in Mail before doing that.</p>
<p>As you can guess, this is somewhat urgent, Thanks, Diane</p>
