<p>My response to Jennifer on 9/2:</p>
<p>Jennifer:</p>
<p>I'd like to start tracking this discussion via our new ticket system. To do that effectively, we need to get you registered with the system so you'll get email updates whenever we post new information to the ticket and also so that you can add comments to the ticket. It'll only take 4 minutes of your time:</p>
<p>=================<br />To use the ticketing system, you must first register yourself a login:</p>
<p>* point a browser at http://ticket.isaw.nyu.edu/<br />* below the picture of the building on the left-hand side, click "login"<br />* on the login dialog box, click "register"<br />* fill in the appropriate information and click the "register" button</p>
<p>On subsequent visits to the site, you will need to login, via the "login" link on the left-hand side. Note that, in the login dialog, you can select the "remember me" check-box so that you are automatically logged in on subsequent visits.<br />=================</p>
<p>To order a replacement computer for you, we'd need to know the following:</p>
<p>* what chart field to use for it (per the last direction I had from Roger, computer purchases for the exhibition team have to go on your account)</p>
<p>* what software you need</p>
<p>Then we can cost it out and get it ordered. If it's a standard model, it might come pretty quickly. Note that if you want a laptop, we're going to have to write a justification and get Roger's approval in advance.</p>
<p>How would you like to proceed?</p>
<p>Tom</p>
