Hi Chris,

I was adding a new event to the website, the ARCE lecture on June 16th. The event needs RSVPs, but when I check that box on the online form, it is automatically populated with isaw@nyu.edu. Would it be possible to change the form slightly so that I would be able to change the RSVP email if I needed to? RSVPs for this event should go to info@arceny.com.

Thanks!

Kate
