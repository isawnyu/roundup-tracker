<p class="p1">From Diane ... indicating that we do need Monish and Anshul to see if they can help here. Looking at rules and whether they move rather than copy (and whether there are other devices accessing the same account with potentially incompatible rules) would be one angle to pursue in my out-of-date opinion.

<p class="p1">Tom,</p>
<p class="p2">I have just spent time with&nbsp;Gelila,&nbsp;ITS support person, who is unable to restore these emails - I would have to restore all of the emails from this period and weed through what's already been dealt with. (I can do this without support.)</p>
<p class="p2">Can either Anshul or Monish look at my desktop and see if there's another way to resolve this? I'm looking at hours of work to restore what was there, which I don't have.</p>
