<p>I have connected the server on Julianna's machine. The 'ISAW Server' is now visible in the left pane under 'Shared' tab in finder. Also 'Public', &nbsp;'Groups' and 'Shared' Folders are now visible as read-only on desktop for easy access. In case of further assistance, please contact Anshul.</p>

<p>P.S.: Add Julianna on the user list too, so that she can reach out to IT in case of any issues.</p>
