One of the swivel chairs for the dining set in the backyard has two bolts on the underside which have come loose because their nuts have fallen off.  I located one on the ground near the chair (I now have it at my desk for safekeeping) but could not find the other one.  The loose bolts are making the chair seem broken, but once the bolts are tightened the chair should be perfectly fine.
