<p>Hi Chris, I replied to your last message by email, but I don't see it here. Just in case you did not receive it, here it is:<br />"I tried to follow your instructions, but when I click on Help, there<br /> is no "Activate Product" Key, only "Change Product" Key. There is a<br /> message saying that this product is unlicensed. If I click on that<br /> button, the wizard asks me to enter the Product Key and when I do that<br /> (using the Product Key that is behind one of the disks you gave me,<br />i.e., FC7HF-CF42G-MX6D7-8K9T7-BT9QT), the wizard says this is not a valid Office Key. Any advice? Many thanks, Nico"</p>
