<p>The printer in your office was migrated as well, it should be in the list of printers but I'm not sure if I made it default or not. My logic might have been that you still might need to print from the PC so I reconnected it. I'll make sure it's moved, the network printers through out the building should also be available. Will leave this open for a while and move out the PC either today or Thursday July 26th.</p>
