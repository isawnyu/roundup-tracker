<p>Tom,<br />For right now, it is working, but I don't know how to interpret the error messages. I put in a ticket when I got error messages this is not a genuine Windows install. However, I cannot fulfill my responsibilities without this, so if it should fail, I have to have it working within a day or two.<br />Diane</p>
