<p>Well, when I first open Parallels (before I even start the virtual <br />machine), it gives me this message:<br />Your virtual machine may run slow because virtualization support is <br />disabled on your Mac.</p>
<p>Then as soon as I have clicked "OK" I get another message:<br />Unable to load the Parallels driver.</p>
<p>I can currently get into Parallels from the student worker computer, so <br />I'm okay for the next few days (I'm out Thursday and Friday), if it is <br />something Chris needs to take a look at.</p>
