wrote library helpdesk, they need to reimage this computer...

Hi,

We're having problems again with the same computer.  I think somebody needs to come up here and take a look at it, I believe it needs to be reimaged.  The following message appears at boot:

**
Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:

\WINDOWS\system32\config\SYSTEM

**

Thanks,

Tim Libert, sys admin - ISAW
