<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>As you saw today at lunch, there is a new visiting student, Roald Dijkstra. He got his ID this morning and his netID is rd1431. If you could generate a copycode for him, and give him access to the ISAW systems so he can put in his own tickets, etc. that would be great.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
