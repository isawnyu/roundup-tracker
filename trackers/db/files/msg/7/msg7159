<p>We ordered 6 license seats of Mac Office 2011 (at $58 apiece) on 1 April 2011 (Purchase Order # EW400889), plus one copy of the&nbsp; <span>OFFICE 2011 MAC MEDIA DVD &nbsp; (for $27). These licenses were intended for the 4 new and replacement Macs we budgeted to buy (Tiffany, 1 other administration machine replacement, 1 faculty replacement, 1 scanner/workstudy replacement). To my knowledge, only two of these machines (Tiffany's) was actually purchased, but I do not know how many of these licenses might have been deployed anyway.&nbsp;</span></p>
