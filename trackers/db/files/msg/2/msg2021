The new copier for the fourth floor was delivered.  The tech showed up before TGI sent a person to unwrap and move the copier into place (and remove the old one) so Ray Perkins and I had a chat about the steps to set up the new copier.  The new copier should be put in place this afternoon (6/28).

The copier must be powered on to obtain the MAC address.  The MAC address must be sent to ITS to obtain an IP address, preferably replacing the equipment at 128.122.167.40.  New drivers may need to be installed on all internal machines.
