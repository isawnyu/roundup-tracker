To ensure that your return is handled promptly and efficiently please follow these steps: 

Packing Your Return:
&#65533; The RMA number should be clearly noted on the shipping label of each box or you may write it on the shipping box. Please do not record the RMA number on the original manufacturer's box.
&#65533; The return box should contain everything from the original shipment, including the original manufacturer's box and packing material, all accessories, UPC bar codes, manuals, etc. that came with the original shipment.
&#65533; If you have multiple packages to return, please make photocopies of the return address that was e-mailed to you and tape one on each package. Please use clear tape or a clear carrier pouch with a self-adhesive back to affix the return address to the box.
&#65533; All boxes should be securely packed to prevent possible damage during shipping. We are not liable for damage that occurs during shipment back to us.
&#65533; We suggest that you insure these return items, as we are not liable for lost merchandise.
