This one is for Michael on Thursday:

Michael:

Via an email from Diane (see below), I learned that Roger may be having some problems with his calendar. I don't think she really understands exactly what his problem is, but I've told them that I'll ask you to check in with him tomorrow (Thursday) to see what the problem is. You might want to let Diane know you've done so, just so the loop is closed. 

Thanks,
Tom
