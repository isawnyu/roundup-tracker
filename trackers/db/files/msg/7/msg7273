<p>Christopher and I talked about this today. Your machine will likely need to be sent off for warranty repair, and this may take some time. Therefore it's clear that we need to get a spare, backup PC purchased for ISAW to use in cases like this. I'm going to be putting together the costing and taking it to Roger for approval, hopefully by the close of business 18 April. Ideally, that would get us the machine in hand by sometime next week and then, subject to getting your files transferred etc. (including juggling against other support issues), we could send it off for repair on replacement. Meantime we're reaching out to our NYU/Dell contract account officers to grease the skids for that effort. In the meantime, can you make sure that your machine is being completely and properly backed up? If you have difficulties with that, please let us know via this (or a new) ticket so that Rohan can work with you on that aspect.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
