It has nothing to do with her.. They close the account and freeze it 4 weeks after a person leaves. So essentially the account has been frozen for sometime.

I'm hoping that the account was frozen but not deleted and that the old email was migrated which would mean it would just need to be reset. The only persons who can do this is security.

I recommend the exhibitions alias being cc'd on important email in the future if you think you'll need access to it at some point. The retention policy seems to be pretty clear but I'm not sure how often it is invoked.
