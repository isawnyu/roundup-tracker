<p>We ordered a new copy of Windows 7 and a new copy of Parallels, both from the NYU computer store in January 2011. iBuy purchase order requisition inquiry number 010511642901. This was transmitted to the computer story as&nbsp;i-Buy Purchase Order #EW381826 (NYU Computer Store) on 5 January. I do not have any email records indicating whether it was received or installed. These were ordered specifically for Kate's machine. Michael was informed they were on order. Do we know if they were ever installed? Is this even the same machine?</p>
