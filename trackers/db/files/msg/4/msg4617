Hold off. Sorry I did mention this in passing but I'm moving up to Kate's office so I don't know if this will be necessary. Move should take place in about a month, I don't want to cause more work for you guys so I think we should wait until I'm on the 5th floor to determine what is needed. Sorry for the late notice.
