<p>Diane,</p>
<p>Hi this is John responding.&nbsp; I have a couple questions.&nbsp; Can Mike get a version of this ticket system that only shows (or sorts to the top) the building items?&nbsp; It seems like he has to wade through a lot of IT tickets to see what is open for the buidling.&nbsp; Also, I used to get e-mails when there were building tickets but I con't get them anymore - can I start getting them again.&nbsp; I would also like access to this new system - do I have it?&nbsp; Perhaps someone could walk me through the log in procedure again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, as to this ticket, Mike explained to me that the light switch is functioning properly, but there is an aesthetic issue with the plate.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; If so, we need a way to separate minor aesthetic issues from a non functioning light.&nbsp; Is there a priority ranking in this system that can be employed.&nbsp; Also stating "this is still not functional" would be an incorrect statement if I am understanding the situation correctly.&nbsp; Do you agree?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help with these requests.</p>
<p>John</p>
