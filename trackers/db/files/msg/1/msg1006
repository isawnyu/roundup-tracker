fixed, installed updates and changed a setting in plls.  in the future if windows ever crashes (and sometimes that is just windows being windows after all) go to the menu 'virtual machine' and select 'stop'.  this is equivalent to holding the power button down on a PC and forcing it to reboot.  you can then start plls up again and it should be fine unless windows is somehow corrupted.
