Hello Christopher,

Jennifer Sy referred me to your below message regarding NYU-NET policies
surrounding the &quot;multi-homing&quot; of end host devices.  Indeed as you
noted, some of the language of the policy page may be a little dated;
our policy and technology security groups in ITS are working with us on
getting this information updated this semester.

However, that said, &quot;dual-homing&quot; of end hosts is not a supported
service/practice at most NYU-NET locations.  One of the main reasons for
this is that there is substantial overhead in managing these types of
links, which results in both added complexity and more troublesome
failure modes.  The main exception to this rule is at the central ITS
Data Center locations, where the physical plant and network were
designed from inception to support specific types of &quot;multi-homing&quot; by
high performance or critical systems running applications used by the
University as a whole.

In addition, the hardware refresh cycle of network electronics on
NYU-NET is centrally managed and architected to provide (and in fact
over-provision) sufficient bandwidth on the campus network to the
majority of end-user/client devices as well as most departmental
servers.  Again, systems requiring extremely high performance or
critical to the functioning of the University should typically be
located in an ITS Data Center).  For example, the access switchports at
your NYU-NET location (ISAW, 15 E84th St), can provide 10, 100, and
1000Mbit/s (Gigabit) Full Duplex Ethernet connections to your devices
over Category6 or better UTP cabling, depending on the capabilities of
the end host's NICs.  In turn, the building network backbones of most of
NYU-NET locations, including ISAW, use single-mode fiber-optic cabling
and are Gigabit Ethernet-based. From our monitoring, we rarely see them
approach even 30% utilization at peak times.  On the DataCenter side,
with 10-Gigabit Ethernet inter-switch trunk links, peak overall
utilization is still generally well under 1 Gig (between a given DC
switch and router), even &lt; 2 Gbits/sec in the case of the main backup
server for the University's Data Warehouse!  Finally, it has been our
experience that for most applications the efficiency of the kernel's
implementation of TCP/IP, not the underlying network infrastructure, is
what caps performance in the &gt;500 Mb/sec range.

Based on our monitoring of the network access switches and other NYU-NET
electronics at ISAW, we have not observed any indication of high
utilization within the building backbone (L2 distribution).  That said,
if your troubleshooting of your backup server performance issue has
indicated a network bottleneck of some kind, then we can certainly do a
&quot;deeper dive&quot; down to the access switchport side to determine if this is
the case.  Our point of contact for system administrators who have
network-related questions or a technical manner is noc@nyu.edu (see the
attached &quot;nyuitscos-networkcontacts.pdf&quot;).  If you feel there is a
network performance issue or bottleneck that is effecting your
application or system, please contact us at noc@nyu.edu and include the
details listed below under the &quot;Request for Network Engineering
Assistance&quot; heading.

On a somewhat related note (at least related to hostmaster),
registration of devices on NYU-NET can be performed by the departmental
IT support personnel or system administrators, using a web-based
application tool we (ITS COS) provide called DNSManager. In fact, this
is the primary way that all staff/departmental device registrations on
campus are handled.  Registration services by Hostmaster is only for
smaller departments without any dedicated or even hybrid IT personnel or
for custom DHCP/DNS requests that cannot be performed via DNSManager.
For more information on DNSManager, pleasee the DNSManager-FAQs.pdf
which can be downloaded here:
https://webspace.nyu.edu/xythoswfs/webui/_xy-3097318_1-t_isIZkVUF

It appears that DNSManager access for ISAW has lapsed with staff
changeover.  The current and sole member of the inactive ISAW group in
DNSManager is tpl210 (Timothy P Libert), who I believe now works for the
Journalism department.  To resolve this discrepancy/gap, we will create
a new Hostmaster ticket to populate the ISAW DNSmanager group with your
current staff as is appropriate.  You will be contacted by hostmaster to
complete this process so you can manage your device registrations for
ISAW via the DNSManager Web UI.

If you have any additional questions or concerns on the above, feel free
to contact me to discuss further.

Thanks,
Yoni
