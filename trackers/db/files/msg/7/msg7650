<p>Ok, unfortunately we'll have to purchase FileMaker Pro as we don't have any licenses for the new version. The latest version that we do have is FileMaker 9 &nbsp;if you're ok with that. Otherwise Exhibitions recently purchased 3 licenses at $179 USD a piece. I've added a temporary logitech mouse along side the one button mouse (which is really two buttons depending if you click on the left or right side of it) as surprisingly that is the only extra two button mouse we currently have. We can eventually repurpose the one connected to your Dell but in the meantime i'd like to keep both systems separate until the switch is final.</p>
<p>The machine is currently backing up and will be readily available starting tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
