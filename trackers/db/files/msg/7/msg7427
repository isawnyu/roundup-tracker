<p>Hi Christopher</p>
<p>The machine on the 3rd floor has a message that state: No VGA Cable.&nbsp; I know this message also sometimes appeared when the machine resided on 4.&nbsp; Chuck and I thought we had fixed the problem, but it has returned.&nbsp; Will you explain the "fix" to me?&nbsp; All cables are snug in their ports.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dawn</p>
