Request purchase of QTY 3 Oxygen XML *Editor* "Academic/Home Edition with Maintenance Pack" via this link: http://www.oxygenxml.com/buy_new_licenses_academic.html

One copy to be installed on each of the intern's computers, and the third on Roger's desktop machine. 

Need these in place before the current "Author" trial licenses run out on the interns' machines; would like this in place before Roger's return on Thursday if possible.

Thanks,
Tom
