Seth,

Thanks for your feedback.  ISAW purchased its first copy of Windows 7 after those instructions were made earlier this summer.  As time permits, we will add additional instructions for Windows 7.

The models of the copiers are:
- 3rd floor - Lanier 275
- 4th floor - Lanier 335

Typically one would choose the PCL6 driver, but for various reasons one might want to use the PostScript driver.  If you're not sure which, then you should use the PCL6.

Once you get to the bit about selecting which driver you want to use, the steps should be identical to installing any other kind of printer.  Unfortunately, I don't have a Windows machine with me to test this.

For the fourth floor copier, the PCL6 driver unzips to a folder named z46397en[1].  Inside that folder is another folder called disk1 and inside that folder is the OEMSETUP file.

I wonder if you may have figured this out already..  I will not be back at ISAW until Monday morning, but I'm happy to help you then if you still need it.

Best regards,
Michael Edgcumbe
