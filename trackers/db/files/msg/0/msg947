Please help me change the following: 

Phone directory recognition changes for Kate and me: 
-I need changes made so that my phone extension no longer shows up as Kate's name when I call others within the NYU lines, and likewise changes should be made to Kate's line so that Kate's name no longer pops up as Anna's when she makes inter-office calls as well.

3rd Fl Copier information: 
-Most importantly, I need my copier code (7843) to now be linked up to my name instead of Kate's, because when I send out work-related pdf scans/emails they're sent out under her name and this has caused several confusions to other office workers.  
I also would like my name and email address included in the directory of saved emails in the copier within the 'Scanner' function. 

I know this is a lot to ask, but I hope this can be relatively soon since the phone lines and the scanner/copier are all things I use on a regular, frequent basis. And if I can help in any way, please let me know! I appreciate it.
