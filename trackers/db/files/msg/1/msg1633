I'll do a presentation on Tuesday (Feb 23) afternoon starting at 2 pm in the seminar room. Can someone help me hook up my laptop (PC) with the projector there? Last time I had problem hooking it up with the projector in the lecture hall and ended up using another laptop. 

I'll be working in my carrel 1-2 pm. Any time within this window is good for me. Thanks!
