<p>Today the drywall tape is hanging 3 feet from the ceiling (new since yesterday) and the paint along the seam is now hanging in sheets (about 3") as well. More spots have appeared on the ceiling drywall.</p>
<p>I am now concerned about mold in this area where the scholars are working and the exposed area is over the wooden cubicle furniture, which is not covered.</p>
<p>This is no water currently dripping from the ceiling. Diane</p>
