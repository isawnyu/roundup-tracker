My computer has gone haywire. The screen started flickering and then everything froze. I did a hard restart and everything was fine for about 5 minutes and then the screen flickering started again, followed by the pinwheel of death. Everything is frozen and I can't work. I went upstairs but both Ben and Chris are gone/not in. Please help!
