<p>What <em>is</em>&nbsp;going on with my computer right now? &nbsp;The monitor went off a while ago but it appears to still be running. &nbsp;However it isn't responding to anything: mouse clicks, keyboard, even hitting the power button (which I only did as a last resort and after waiting for more than 30 minutes for it to come back on) doesn't seem to do anything. &nbsp;I'm writing this from the 606 computer. &nbsp;I'm going to go to lunch, you can write a response here and I will check for it if my computer hasn't come back on by then.</p>
