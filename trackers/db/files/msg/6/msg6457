<p>In response to the second paragraph.</p>
<p>The ticket system is organized based on activity. So if one is working a ticket it is automatically bumped to the top of the list in display. This allows anyone viewing the ticket system at a given moment the ability to see what was the most recently edited, modified or commented ticket. In an effort to balance usefulness with need the decision to remove the date from the front page display was made. The date of messages are directly inside of the ticket, including military time down to the second in UTC (i'll probably go ahead and change this to -5 EST/EDT when I get a chance)</p>
<p>As far as sorting based on date as stated in ticket 1534 -&nbsp;<a href="issue1534">http://ticket.isaw.nyu.edu/help/issue1534</a>&nbsp;I'll need to split &nbsp;isawit/web/building/research into a useful grouping display on the front page so one can click the heading and have them sorted based on date instead of activity. Again, all prioritizing of these changes and additions will need to be discussed with Tom an/or Roger. My time is finite as I do the programming, design, building, organization, administration etc myself.</p>
