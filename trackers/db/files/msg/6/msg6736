<p>Before I leave for Egypt Friday, I'd like to have Christopher look at my iPhone to make sure all is in order, as he was out when it arrived; calendar is particularly important. Also, apparently Jennifer has lost access to my calendar. Finally, my portable hard drive is telling me (when attached to my home iMac) that I have read-only access, whereas my PC allows me to do anything I want, and I can't figure out how to do anything about this. I will hardly be in this week because of Common Days, but Thursday 2:30-4 I will be in and not yet in a meeting.</p>
