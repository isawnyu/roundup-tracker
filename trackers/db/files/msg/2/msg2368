For what it's worth:

Christopher: I was doing some other work on the listserv and had a look at this too. All of those addresses failed DNS lookups at the same time (down to the second) and date(!!). It may have been a transient DNS failure. I'll email you both a copy of the full log. 

Unfortunately, the listserv has purged earlier delivery logs which are likely showing the recurrence of the error as reported by Alex. I've changed the retention settings from 5 days to 120 days, so hopefully we'll be able to get a history on this if it happens again while you're working the question with ITS etc.

Best,
Tom
