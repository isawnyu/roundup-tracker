<p>Hi Chris Warner,<br />I left you a voice mail message on x27845 too. I am not familiar with the work you were following up on. A survey of rooms 605 and 606? Who were you working with to coordinate this? Really, any other info you have would be helpful!</p>
<p>Call me, email me, whatever you prefer!</p>
<p>By the way, if you want to change the name that people hear when they call 27845 and leave a message (or that they hear when you use 27845 to leave voice mail messages), since Michael Edgecumb is gone, you can:<br />Log into 27845 voice mailbox<br />At main menu, press 5<br />At submenu, press 5<br />Follow prompts to re-record the name.</p>
<p>Doesn't have to be your name if that is your preference...</p>
<p>Look forward to hearing from you!</p>
