<p>The research associates would like copies of the keys to the file cabinets in room 404 so they can secure items in the drawers (this has been approved by Diane).&nbsp; We need three copies each of the keys with the codes "UM403" and UM395" on them.&nbsp; As this is for an office, not a carrel, I don't have copies of these keys, and there isn't a number from Mike's filing system, so that's the only identifying information I can provide.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
