Hi,
Kate told me you could help. On March 24 I am going to run a workshop in 2nd floor seminar room and I need help will all the following to prepare:
1)how to use the av setup in the seminar room
2)how to get my computer access to the ISAW wifi network
3)information about what computer to use for the workshop 
4)I'll need an extension cord and a regular screen on the 24th, because one of the participants is bringing slides (I have a slide projector which I will bring, but need to plug it in and have a screen to us)
5)  I will be at ISAW on Monday March 7.  I have an appointment at 4 pm, but could come earlier in the afternoon if someone would be available to aid me to move from ignorant to competent on that day.

Thanks.
Karen
