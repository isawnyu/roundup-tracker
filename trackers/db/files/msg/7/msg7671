<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>Are you in the office the week of July 16? I'd love to set aside an hour or so with you to get all my NYU stuff up and running. My iCal, mail, etc. are all still linked in to Julienne's info and I need to switch it over to mine. Plus, I have multiple email accounts now that I have a Net ID and I need to merge them into one without losing my folders or past mail (and, if possible, keep Julienne's mail as well).</p>
<p>I'm in all week that week, so just let me know the day and time that is best for you and I will put it on my calendar.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Alexander</p>
