<p>Yesterday my Mac crashed in the middle of working with Shelby. Rohan helped restore it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had about 5 browser windows open and went into pinwheel of death. Took a break thinking it needed to resolve something, but 30 min later it is still spinning. Cannot close any windows, but I can bring them to the front, so there is some responsiveness. Cannot pull any mail. &nbsp;Diane</p>
