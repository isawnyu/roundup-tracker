<p>We have been buying recycled cartridges from Staples (NYU policy), which we are no longer doing. I found out that's because they are discontinuing the program - this is not an ISAW policy.</p>
<p>We did have Staples just come and recondition the printer at their expense. We have replaced 3 of the 4 cartridges in the past week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These toner cartridges are so expensive and should last for months, so we don't have another black toner cartridge to swap out.&nbsp;</p>
