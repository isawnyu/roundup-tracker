<p>Diane should be all remedied, will leave this ticket open if there is some form of regression. However, I suspect she will need a new hard drive soon. This is an early 2010 Apple machine and I believe some were recalled for failing hard drives but the machine could probably use a full wipe and migration of her account anyway. This is a different ticket but we should keep an eye on it.</p>
