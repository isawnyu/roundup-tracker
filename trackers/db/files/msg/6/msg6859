<p>Diane has gone from 4GB to 12GB which should help immensely with all of the swapping to the drive. The computer still needs to see Apple but i'll try and coordinate that appointment, as it would mean delivering the desktop etc.<br /><br />Irenes mac swap will take place tomorrow. The ram for the three iMacs are on backorder but the drives are in so I'll will attempt at a swap out if not tomorrow, the week after next depending on my schedule and what I can actually get done. Which should see Abby resolved; we'll see.</p>
