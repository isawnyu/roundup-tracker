<p>John B. Here:&nbsp; Mike did a test and is hoping that the area will remain dry now.&nbsp; If you notice any moisture after the next big rain, please let Mike know.&nbsp; If it stays dry through a couple rains, then Mike will patch and repaint.&nbsp; Thanks for keeping us in the loop on this.</p>
