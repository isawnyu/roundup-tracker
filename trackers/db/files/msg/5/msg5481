<p>I just fixed this for Irene, she wasn't an Administrator on her machine... It seems there is/was some policy where standard users are not administrators of their own machines.<br /><br />Today and going forward that policy is no longer acceptable. Every user should have Administrator privileges on the machine they are working with.&nbsp;</p>
