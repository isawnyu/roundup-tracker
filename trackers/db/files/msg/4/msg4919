Ticket migration is nearing completion, a couple of UI cleanups remain and a final dump of the tickets here in osticket need to be transferred over. I'll document that migration soon. Friday into next week will be dedicated to the registration system. When that is complete I'll spend the first week in August documenting this and handing off the documentation.
