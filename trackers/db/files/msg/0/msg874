Mike / Duane:

Would it be possible to do a wipe-down / dusting of the 5th floor carrels? Most of our 2009 VRS have left - and the new class of scholars will begin trickling in on Monday.

I'd like to begin assigning carrels to them, but of course, they need to be tidy for their arrival.

Many thanks,
Suzan
