<p>The previous exploded magenta cartridge spilled toner through-out the printer. The issue here is that once an exploded cartridge happens, it fills the tiny crevices in the printer such that the toner powder eventually spills out over time and with shifts of printing etc etc. There is nothing that can be done except to throughly clean the internals of the printer. This is an expensive process that will require a vacuum with an electrical conductive nozzle or some such and full disassembly.</p>
<p>There is nothing more that we can do sadly. Hopefully overtime the pink toner eventually drops out or spills out from the crevices but once you get an exploded cartridge the way we've had them in this printer, it is generally ruined. We can probably have HP support come and take the whole thing apart and replace the toner covered parts but they'll probably also state that it's likely cheaper to buy a new printer.</p>
<p>If the cartridge that exploded was HP manufactured they would cover the entire cost, that is unfortunately not the case.</p>
