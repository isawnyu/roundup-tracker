<p><span>I just updated Irene to 4 GB due to a difference in ram module configuration. That said, it may be necessary to swap the 24 inch that currently sits in 605/606 so that Irene has something that is a little less dated. Her iMac is a 7,1 but it'll be about 5 years old in a couple of months. The faster machines will be useful for her parallels and such. The 24 inch machine is heavily under utilized and this just make sense.</span></p>
<div>In it's place we'll get some new ram modules for the older machines and triple our capacity. So that we have three iMacs instead of just the 24 inch and hopefully this will keep us for quite sometime without having to necessarily make any immediate major upgrades for the next couple of months.<br /><br />I'll have to plan when exactly i'll do this.. etc etc but I'd like to do it before the end of Jan.</div>
