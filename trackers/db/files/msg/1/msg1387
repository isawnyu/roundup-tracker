Sean,

You have two accounts.  One is a server admin account and the other is a standard account.  The standard account credentials are:
seangilles
1221

Although I agree that we would benefit from having a mechanism to reset passwords to a user's choice, Suzan and Roger decided to use the system currently in place.  

Please let me know if you have any trouble with the login.
