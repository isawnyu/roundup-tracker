This maybe a nyu email server issue. I'll send out an ITS ticket and monitor the situation with Beate to make sure it's not an isolated incident related to her account. In the event that its is having problems with their email servers or uptime/downtime/maintenance etc I will update.

It is highly likely that is the case but we will monitor the situation.
