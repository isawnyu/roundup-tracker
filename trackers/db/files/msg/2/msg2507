These folks need to learn how to write. It took several tries to decode what he said, because it doesn't work tried directly on an attachment to an email message. But it did work on a file stored on my disk, so I clicked "change", and lo and behold, the criminal Picture Viewer was shown as the program. I changed it, and then it was possible to click on an attachment and have it opened properly. Let's see if it still works tomorrow! Thanks.
