Chuck,

The breakdown comes to something like this..

I have two options for PCs:
1) Bare Bones:  Dell Vostro 220 + 20in monitor = $498
2) Slightly better:  Dell Vostro 220 + 20 in monitor = $548

One option for Apple:
1) Mac mini + 20 in monitor = $807

So it really comes down to justifying $500 to automatically wipe the machines over the course of their lifetime.

I have copies of the actual builds I'll leave for you.
