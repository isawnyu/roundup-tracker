<p>Yesterday when adding content to <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/publications">http://isaw.nyu.edu/publications</a>&nbsp;page, I uploaded two images. The "Publications" item of the global navigation menu (the one to the left) now shows those. I didn't mean for that to happen and I don't know how to adjuest the contents of the menu. Sorry about that. And if I can be briefly told how to have that not happen next time, that would be great. Otherwise, I'll ask Chris directly.</p>
