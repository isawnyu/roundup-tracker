<p>This one isn't for Ben, the isaw server is quite frankly in a mess and no one besides myself should be doing indexing, searching, reorganization or any administration of any sort until I have a handle on it. As it stands all of Suzan's desktop is actually in "Documents" as a shared folder. Including VRS Salaries, Roger's signature etc etc.. I need to get a hold of this.&nbsp;</p>
