<p>Hi, Christopher.</p>
<p>1) Yesterday, Fan tried to save scans to her flash drive, but the process froze midway (the screen greyed-out).</p>
<p>She removed the flash drive and opened it; there were scanner files, but they were nonsense.</p>
<p>She then tried to send the scans via e-mail, but, again, the process froze midway.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we had to restart, so she lost her scans.</p>
<p>2) We also learned that Rita scanned something the other day, and while the first portion of the scan was fine, at some point, the scanned pages became progressively degraded/blurred, so were unusable.</p>
