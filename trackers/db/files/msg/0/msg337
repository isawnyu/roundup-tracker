Hi Tim,

One of our Guest Curators came up with a very good idea for working on one of our exhibitions (see below):


\"I think it would be a good idea to put everything we have on the excavation and its sculptures online, so that everybody who needs it can get access to all the material. Is there any way that ISAW can make a site available? Have you done such a thing before?\"

Is there any way of making this happen? Basically, it would be a password protected site where we could post research materials for the various contributors around the world to view and work off of. Kind of like our share drive only a site.

Thanks so much,

Julienne
