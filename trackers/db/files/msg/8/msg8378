<p>My commentary is that there is little that we can actually do about this. Even though this sounds like the standard inconsistency of the format between Microsoft teams, there is no work-around fix that I know of for these issues other than to wait for an update. Please make sure Microsoft Office is updated. Other than that the Office of Sustained Engineering at Microsoft (<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/office_sustained_engineering/">http://blogs.technet.com/b/office_sustained_engineering/</a>)&nbsp;should be able to help but they are in a continuous cycle of release for problems.</p>
<p>In the interim you can try <a href="http://libreoffice.org">http://libreoffice.org</a>&nbsp;to see if it can help with the conversion issue and if so, save to .doc/.docx from there..&nbsp;</p>
