Hi Tom,

Thank you for the information. I apologize that I am not being clear but what I am looking for is a completely new address that can be accessed through NYU Home and does not have to be linked to an already existing email. Is this possible? If it is not possible, I will be sure to contact askits@nyu.edu for an alias.

Thanks,
Irene
