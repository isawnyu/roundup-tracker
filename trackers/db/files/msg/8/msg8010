<p>Kate wanted to know if we could modify the addressbook to add users.. We should probably discuss this in detail to see exactly what the needs are and what its being used for. As Addressbook can be easily connected to nyu contacts. This way new students don't need to be added, as they are already apart of the nyu directory.</p>
