<p>The arch station is in, i'm not sure if I will get it completed this week, I promised to tie up some of the long standing website issues, it's been a very long while since I last did anything there. Maybe I can spend some time on it Thursday, but it will definitely not be completed, If I don't make that window then it's something that will have to wait. Exhibitions needs machines setup and i'm not exactly sure how i'm going to manage that just yet.</p>
