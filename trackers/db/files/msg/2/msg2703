The elevator, the 6th floor hallway and stairs landing, and the stairs between the 5th and 6th floors need to be swept. The landing on the 6th floor also needs the railings dusted from all the construction dust. There are also bits of blue tape on the floor at the entrance to the 6th floor, at the top of the stairs that need to be taken up.
