<p>Waiting for some contact in this regard from Darin Phelps.. If I don't hear anything we'll have to either go ahead and route around which I would seriously want to avioid or figure something else out. The problem is that box.com has a trial going on with nyu as an entity and would rather not waste resources and time floating multiple requests for all of the different universities. We'll see what happens here but if I'll keep kicking this can down the road.</p>
