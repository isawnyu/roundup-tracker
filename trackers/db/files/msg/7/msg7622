<p>I will be in on Friday and pretty free, so I can be available for any consultation needed. But after that I'll be in the office only one day for a few weeks, with various travels, so getting this up and running should not be put ahead of other high-priority (or even medium-priority) needs that may be holding up other people's productivity.</p>
