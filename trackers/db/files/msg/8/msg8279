<p>Because of the open house this weekend, Diane sat at Dawn's desk in the Library on 3.&nbsp; She reports the library as being warm on Saturday and warmer on Sunday.</p>
<p>This is a reminder that the climate in the library is determined by conservartion requirements for the collection of books, and not for the ccomfort of humans.&nbsp; The temperature and humidity levels should therefore be controlled within the established tolerances 24/7 and not turned off on the weekends.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
