<p>Chris,</p>
<p>Unlike last year, we are not making many telecom changes. Please initiate the telecom paperwork for implementation Aug 20 of the following:<br />Move x27808 (the Research Associate line in 404) to 603.<br />Move x27803 (Nicola Aravecchia) to 404. Please add vmail if it doesn't have it now.<br />(I realize the phones can be swapped, but ITS tracks and reassigns the ports, as I understand it.)</p>
<p>Please add a new extension to Robert Hoyland's office 403 by Aug 31. This should have vmail and the same setup as all the faculty.<br />We will be adding a phone for Dan Potts (503) later in the year for his arrival in January.</p>
<p>Any questions, let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />Diane</p>
