<p>The folders are not showing when I open the drive, so if they are there and I have privileges, I don't know how to get to them. The only folders I seem to have access to are the Drop Box and Streaming. I do not keep direct links to folders but prefer to go to the drive and find the folders I need.</p>
<p>For example, there was a folder of Grant information that Tom, Tiffany and I were working on that I can't access. The building photos are also of urgent need and so on.</p>
<p>I have not been on the server in a couple of months, so I'm not saying something has changed in the past few weeks. Just looking to access the files I need now that the work is completed.</p>
<p>Thanks, Diane</p>
