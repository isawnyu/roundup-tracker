<p>Diane's hard drive is failing and needs to be replaced.. &nbsp;27 inch late 2009..&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the hd is junked we'll need to zero it out to make sure that the controller isn't failing on bad blocks. If that's the case and the bad block list isn't full then we need to reinstall but we'll see.</p>
