<p>Ok, so let me run this down for you rather quickly.</p>
<p>The native autosave stuff that you see from the demos in OSX Lion about the web aren't available in Microsoft Office just yet. They have yet to add the functionality to the program. So if you use textedit you'll see that it saves versions etc etc.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office saves copies of the files based on autosave so in the interim you can go Time Machine and find the saved file from X time of day and pull it back that way. I can go into a bit more extensive detail if you'd like but I'm assuming since this was opened you've delved into this issue a bit more. Let me &nbsp;know</p>
