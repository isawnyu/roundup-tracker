Hi Tom,

I need an urgent change to the Early Chinese position posted to the the web now that it is being solely carried by ISAW. Please be sure to include the revised date in there. Thanks!


(Revised February 18, 2011)

The Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York University, seeks to make an appointment at the rank of Assistant Professor in the study of early Chinese art and archaeology, preferably the Bronze Age. We seek a scholar whose research analyzes ancient artifacts in their broader historical context with innovative perspectives. Applicants with a history of interdisciplinary exchange are particularly welcome. The ISAW faculty works with graduate students, leading research seminars and individual tutorials, directing independent work, and supervising dissertations (see http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/graduateprogram.htm). The faculty is also involved in choosing a group of visiting researchers each year (see http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/vrs-program.htm). 
The candidate must have completed a Ph. D. in art history, archaeology, or East Asian studies by January 2011. 

Application deadline is December 1, 2010. Please submit a detailed letter of application, curriculum vitae, and three letters of reference through the NYU online application system at www.nyuopsearch.com/applicants/Central?quickFind=50686. NYU is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

Questions should be directed to Kathryn Lawson, Academic Program Coordinator, at kathryn.lawson@nyu.edu or 212-992-7860.
