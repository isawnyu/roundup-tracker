HI,

My AC does not work well. It does not blow cold air and it's been on now a good half an hour. I've tested other AC's (Peter's office) and that office cools right away and is larger. It's not urgent as I can just sit in Peter's office if it gets too hot. And it's not unbearable in my office. However, I believe there is something wrong with my unit. The heating was faulty in the winter as well. 

Many thanks,
