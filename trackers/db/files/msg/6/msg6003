<div>Dear IT Support,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is an urgent message from Jennifer that bounced back to her so she asked me to create a ticket re: her issues with email.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hi Tom and Chris:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am very sorry to bother you both via email, but I am in KZ and am having some major problems with technology. &nbsp;I cannot get into my email via&nbsp;<a href="http://home.nyu.edu/">home.nyu.edu</a>&nbsp;(or for that matter onto&nbsp;<a href="http://tickets.isaw.nyu.edu/">tickets.isaw.nyu.edu</a>). &nbsp; This means I cannot read my email, which I use to communicate with the various offices that I will be meeting with here as well as the KZ ambassador to the US. &nbsp; This would not be a problem if my iphone were working but it is not. &nbsp; I turned my international service on before I left, which has done the trick in the past. &nbsp;This time, however, I keep getting the following message&nbsp;&nbsp;"mail server&nbsp;<a href="http://imap.gmeail.com/">imap.gmail.com</a>&nbsp;is not responding. Verify that you have entered the correct account info in Mail settings." &nbsp;I have gone through the account settings and have found nothing wrong, I have tried to trouble shoot on the internet, and I have asked the woefully insufficient it guy here for help. &nbsp;Do either of you have any quick suggestions? &nbsp;I would not bother you with this, but I can't get access to my email and dont have a way of communicating with the Museums and Ministry now, so I am a bit worried about missing appointments now.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks for your help!,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Jennifer</div>
