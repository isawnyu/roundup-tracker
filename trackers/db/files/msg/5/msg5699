<p>NYU has a special deal with Autodesk that will allow you to purchase a 13-month license of AUTOCAD for only $150. It would run out in September of next year, at which time you could purchase another. The only restriction is that you can only run it on one NYU-owned machine. It's actually a large package of software that includes AUTOCAD. The other components included are listed here:&nbsp;http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=13163166</p>
<p>The alternative is to buy a permanent one-seat license for AUTOCAD only for $1,395. It would never run out, but of course does not include updates etc.</p>
<p>If you would like to pursue one or the other of these approaches, please confirm which one and what account you would like to use for the purchase (e.g., your research account).</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
