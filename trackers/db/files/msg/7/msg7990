<p>Something is going on with the network at ISAW.. Bonjour is no longer working, SMB is no longer working for the printers.. None of this is making sense and is just causing more issues.</p>
<p>1. We need to find out why network changes are being made that affect standard protocols from working. Whatever that is, it's just not productive.<br />2. This seems to be an occurence whenever the start of the new semester rolls around. At exactly the time we need this to work. We need to find out if this is a NYUNET policy and prepare for it ahead of time.<br />3. ISAW administrators need to know if network changes are being made to our block on NYUNET so that we can not only be prepared but respond to issues without having to make educated guesses. It's simply a huge time sink at the wrong period.</p>
