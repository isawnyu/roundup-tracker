Victor has not yet been able to solve my problem--but not for want of interest or trying! I had a message from him yesterday to send him my origianl email so he could see all the code in the header. I haven't been able yet to respond, but I intend to (it's a bit complex for me!). So please do not consider this issue closed. I STILL cannot emial via NYU form home (only when at an NYU facility like ISAW or Bobst) & my FROM address STILL reads "NYU."
