Hi Tim,

We are unable to open either Internet Explorer or Firefox on Anna's computer.  There is no error message.  She is able to connect to Aleph, but cannot access any of the tools needed to catalog.  For now, I have asked her to move to a PC at one of the labeling stations.  Will you come down and take a look?  

Thanks,
Dawn
