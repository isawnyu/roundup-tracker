<p>Hi All;<br /><br />&nbsp; I have received a wireless AP to be installed on the&nbsp;<span class="il">5th</span>&nbsp;<span class="il">floor</span>&nbsp;of ISAW, on the ceiling, by the elevator. &nbsp;When would it be possible to do this work. &nbsp;It shouldnt take more than 30 minutes, and there will be some drilling involved. &nbsp;But it shouldnt be too noisy.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks<br /><span style="color: #888888;"><br />--&nbsp;<br />NYU ITS Communications Operations Services<br />Matthias Lee<br />726 Broadway, 8th&nbsp;<span class="il">floor</span><br /><a href="tel:212%20998%203436" target="_blank">212 998 3436</a></span></p>
