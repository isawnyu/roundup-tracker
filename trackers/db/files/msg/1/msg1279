Hi Tom,

Looking through the website, Yoojin and I noticed a few errors. 

On the Administration Page, the ISAW Main Phone line at the bottom of the page still reads 7800

On the Graduate Student bio page, Zoe's email should be zmm204@nyu.edu

On the VRS bio page, it looks like the special characters (i.e. letters with accents) have disappeared so some people's names now have missing letters.
