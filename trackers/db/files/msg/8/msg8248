<p>Hi all. I have fixed the issues on both the machines in the exhibitions room. There was a bluetooth driver issue in the machines. Also, the last time I left them, both bluetooth and Software updates were turned off. But apparently both of them were turned on when I checked today. This caused interference with the kiosk mode everytime the machine started up. I have turned both of them off. I would request Abby to make sure they are never turned on for smooth working of kiosk mode.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
