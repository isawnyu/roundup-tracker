Beate:

Congratulations on your promotion! I regret that we hadn't been informed through other channels. 

You'll see that I've already updated your title on the faculty page at http://www.nyu.edu/isaw/faculty.htm (you may have to refresh/reload your browser page to see the latest content).

I'll be keeping this ticket open and turning it over the Michael and Christopher so one of them can arrange to guide you through updating your signature settings on your email client.

Best,
Tom
