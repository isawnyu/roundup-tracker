<p>AFS brought the server down into a hard lock and kernel oops after a required security update, which stopped file sharing. This was because the name Groups conflicted somewhere in the setup. This is becoming more pertinent of an issue but I don't have anytime to spend on it right now. Hopefully it'll continue slogging along for a little while until we reach a reactive stage in where all of our data is either unavailable for a couple of days or something else. I'll try to get to it before that point obviously but my confidence in our current setup is non-existent.&nbsp;</p>
