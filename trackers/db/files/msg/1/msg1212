Top this is a list of notes I've been keeping on the subject of introducing new Scholars to the system...

1. Obtain list of incoming scholars
	- from Kate Lawson

2. Setup copier codes
	- 128.122.167.37 - Third Floor Copier
	- 128.122.167.40 - Fourth Floor Copier
	- Copier codes are the four digit representation of the number in the NYU Net ID.  For example, if a net id is mae14, the copier code is 0014
	- Each person's account name, copier code, and email address should be entered.  All of the options for printing, scanning, copying, etc. should be turned on.

3. Setup server accounts
	- each user gets a user account on the server for access to the wiki
	- the short name should be their user ID
	- the password should be their copier code
	- they should be granted access to the isaw and Workgroup groups

4. Setup wireless credentials
	- each person should be setup with access to the NYU wireless network
	- the credentials are the user's netID and password
	- the network is a WPA2
	- on a Mac, the 802.1X should be set to Automatic - the Mac will typically pick up everything automatically
	- on a PC, the setup is more complicated and specific to each user's computer manufacturer/model
	- the instructions for setting up a PC are here:  http://www.nyu.edu/its/wireless/configure/nyu.html
	
5. Setup printers
	- each user should have access to both copiers (listed above)
	- 128.122.167.37 - Lanier LD 275
	- 128.122.167.40 - Lanier LD 345
	- Windows XP sets them up through an IP address on a LOCAL port, not through the &quot;network&quot; option as one might imagine
	- Better to use the actual drivers from the company than the generic postscript drivers on the Mac
	
6. Setup listserv access
	- a moderator should setup the email accounts on lists.nyu.edu
	- the username to access the server is the moderator's full email address
	- the password is the NetID password

7. Register any wired requests
	- activate the data jack if necessary with an ITS Request Form
	- hostmaster@nyu.edu w MAC address and data jack number or ITS request form above
