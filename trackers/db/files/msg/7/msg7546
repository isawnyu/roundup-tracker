<p>This is an OS level context editing bug which I'm sure was fixed in later versions of OSX. Kate's laptop machine wasn't upgraded due to the fact that she is currently on a 5 or 6 year old machine as there is a work-around she's been using that and the really remedy would be to update her laptop and cycle out the old one. For those reasons I'm applying WONTFIX on this one.&nbsp;</p>
