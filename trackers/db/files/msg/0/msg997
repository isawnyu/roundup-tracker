Hi Mike/Duane:

There were a few items mentioned to me while Richard and Shelby were in the building today; I hope you don't mind if I quickly go through the list:

1.) Please dust the shelves and the furniture in the Oak Library

2.) Please dust the cubicles (and the sides of the cubicles) on the fourth floor

3.) Please make sure all ceiling lights on the fourth floor near the cubicles are identical.

Thank you, both. Sorry for any extra trouble.
Suzan
