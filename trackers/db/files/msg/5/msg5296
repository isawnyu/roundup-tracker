I attempted to call both Diane and Kate about this this afternoon and left voicemail on their phones. 

For Geo. Hatke:

* he needs to check his NYU email (he can use any web browser on any computer for this ... the library mac minis if nothing else) to get his copier codes and website sign-on email. This was sent on 6/29 at Kate's request and re-sent yesterday at her request. Kate has had a copy of his copier codes since 6/29.

* he can use his net id to log on to NYU wifi, instructions here: http://www.nyu.edu/its/wireless/configure/

* he should contact Christopher, either via a helpdesk ticket or via email, to make an appointment to get his computer hooked up to ethernet and printers
