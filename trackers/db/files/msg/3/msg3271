This is now fixed on the main website. I also removed Roberta. All ISAW personnel will have their own profile pages on the new website. These will be accessible via the &quot;people&quot; menu, and subgrouped into &quot;faculty&quot;, &quot;staff&quot;, &quot;students&quot;, etc. Department heads will have the ability to create departmental staff lists under &quot;about&quot; -&gt; department-name -&gt; &quot;staff&quot; by adding links to relevant profiles in the people portion of the site.

Best,
Tom
