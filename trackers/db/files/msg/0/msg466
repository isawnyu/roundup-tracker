Irene,

They actually haven't made G4's for a long time, but we could get an Apple Macbook which is the current iteration of that line.  Suzan, who is copied on this message, can let you know how to go about getting the funds.  Once you have that end figured out I can help you get the computer from the NYU computer store.  The older white Macbook is $899 from NYU and the updated aluminum Macbook is $1149.  You will also need to get AppleCare which is $183.  I would also highly recommend getting additional RAM which is necessary to run Parallels for $100.

The computer store page with academic prices is here: http://www.bookstores.nyu.edu/computer.store/apple.prices.html
The website for the Macbook is here: http://www.apple.com/macbook/

Also, I am going to open a ticket for this in your name so we can track progress.

Thanks,

Tim
