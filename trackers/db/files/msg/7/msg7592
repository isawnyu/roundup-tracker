<p>Judith:</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response. It's not a question of not having <br />followed protocol; it's perfectly fine for collaborations and new <br />initiatives to develop informally. But if and when they hit bumps in the <br />road, grow bigger than expected, or start to cause frustration, it's <br />time to get more formal and move them into the category of tasks we <br />track more formally.</p>
<p>So, I'll get the draft description bit onto the publications page for <br />Roger to review and make public ... then you, Christopher, and I can <br />follow up about the remaining tasks.</p>
<p>Best,<br />Tom</p>

My<br />&gt; hope was to have a prelim page ready before I left the US two weeks ago<br />&gt; for Roger and Shelby to see and comment (I understand that she wanted to<br />&gt; have more visuals on the ISAW site and we can certainly offer that). We<br />&gt; would have then refined it, based on feedback, and added more<br />&gt; images...We hoped that it would then be ready to go. I'm sorry if the<br />&gt; way in which we developed it did not conform to protocol; if so, I was<br />&gt; not aware, especially as we talked about it at the anniversary dinner.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; I'll use the www.doodle site you indicated to set up a time to<br />&gt; speak--Skype would be good. I see that you're busy all this week and I<br />&gt; must resolve some things on my end for the next before I can add myself<br />&gt; to your calendar.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Thanks,<br />&gt; Judith--&nbsp;</p>
