<p>Alex's door was again open this morning. Since it was closed and locked when I tried it yesterday, it would routinely be opened daily for security to check the window &amp; ac at closing and to empty trash in the morning.</p>
<p>Please let Alex know this is being addressed, as he is concerned that he has not received an acknowledgement.</p>
<p>Thanks, Diane</p>
