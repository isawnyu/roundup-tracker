<p>If it was a mistake or harmless I would have said so, plain and simple. This, however is the case of someone simply putting everything on mute and shutting the entire audio system down, everything was toggled to mute. It's upsetting because it's a waste of everyones time trying to diagnose the issue. We spend a full morning wasting time like this, when we could be doing something else.</p>
<p>I'm going to stop commenting on this ticket because it actually has me angry for some reason and that will not be productive. I'd request that next time we simply call the company in to solve these issues.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
