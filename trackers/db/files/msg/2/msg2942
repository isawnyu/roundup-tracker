In the last few days, both of my flash drives have started behaving oddly; either I am denied access to them, or I can\'t open them because \"some other program is using them\". One of them has a file that I didn\'t put on it that I can\'t erase--but Symantec gives it a clean bill of health. I don\'t know if I have some kind of infection or there is a problem with the drives (or Windows).
