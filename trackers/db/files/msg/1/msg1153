Dear Michael, could we set an appointment to connect my laptop to the wireless network? I am around later this pm and I could do tomorrow late morning as well. I won't be able to check my mail until later this pm since I dont have a US blackberry yet. I am located at 3rd floor, next to Nicola. Kind regards, GB.
