With Kate's assistance I got into ISAW and into the IT office.  I have left the offending laptop on the deck in the place where the spare is, which I have taken with me.  Oddly enough the problematic machine is working without symptoms this morning.

I'm back in two weeks.

All doors are now locked.

Thanks,
