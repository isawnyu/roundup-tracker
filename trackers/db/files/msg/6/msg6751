<p>Dear Cabinet,<br /><br />I would like to automate the weekly reminder for cabinet headlines, which I tried to share with your calendars this morning. This will automatically send you a reminder at the same time of the week I would have sent a reminder.&nbsp;<br /><br />I added it to the calendars I am able to, but I cannot add it to these email addresses. Please let me know if you can share it with these calendars yourself or if we need a different technical solution.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Diane<br /><br />Diane W.
