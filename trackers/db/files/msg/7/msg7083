<p>Currently we have a total of three access points on the 6th floor, I'm not sure why this is. The library has two access points on the 4th and 5th floor located all the way to the north top wall. I suspect that the module located towards the buildings north end on the 6th floor isn't actually required there. &nbsp;The horizontal coverage of the antenna would be more useful actually on the 4th floor. &nbsp;I want to move the cisco aironet with the mac address 5475D0297328 to the 4th floor to see if it helps.</p>
