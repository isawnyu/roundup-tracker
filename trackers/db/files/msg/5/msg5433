<pre>It happens every now and then. Your desktop and/or laptop gives up the ghost or has failed you in some manner. There maybe a piece of software that you need where you don't have enough memory or hard disk space. Or depending on your needs you may just need limited use of another machine for a short period. 

Starting today and currently in RM 606 you can utilize the 24-inch IMAC Desktop (which also has Windows XP and Windows 7 installed) for such needs. The computer currently has a plethora of software installed. Microsoft Office, Adobe CS5, Skype, (if you find yourself needing software that isn't there please feel free to let me know and we'll look into adding it) etc and is open to all ISAW staff, visiting research scholars and faculty.

As the machine is less than a stones throw away you can be sure it is always in working condition.

Please do not save anything of importance on the machine itself as it is subject to be removed. We do have loaner USB keys in those cases. Otherwise, that's it, no small print. Enjoy.

Thanks,
