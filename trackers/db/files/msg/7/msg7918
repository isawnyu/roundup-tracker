<p>I am again getting this exasperating message in trying to send a file to the color Laserjet 3600 in Whitney's area. It is obviously false (the printer is indeed there, turned on, filled with paper, and connected). I do not know whart the nature of the problem is, as my panel shows me as connected to the network.</p>
