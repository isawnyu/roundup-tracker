Dear Michael,

As you might have seen in my other email, I can't connect to my NYU account at ISAW. I followed up the case with ITS, and they told me as I have changed my password (They send us an email and asked for that) I need to reconfigure my connection. Could you please kindly assist me to do that. I am in the end of semester and have already missed 2 days because of not being able to connect. Thank you very much.
