<p>Could we look into upgrading the memory on the 3rd floor student work computer?&nbsp; We need Julianna to help us with tasks in BRIO quite frequently and it is running incredibly slow in Parallels. (Last week it took almost ten minutes just to open one of the detail reports in Acrobat.) That computer also serves as a backup for the administrative team when work is being done on their own computers (for instance, when Kate was waiting for Parallels to be installed on her new computer recently) so it would be helpful to have it function better.</p>
