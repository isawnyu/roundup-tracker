<p>Had a wonderful meeting with Oleg who showed me the scanner setup that they have at the MET. They have several Bookeye 4's through-out and two Bookeye 2's in the back that they keep around. The same exact problems that we have with our Bookeye 2, they also have. &nbsp;He recommended for the USB key setup to simply sell known USB keys that work. In the interim I setup the Bookeye 2 at ISAW in the same exact manner as the Bookeye 2's at the MET. The only exception is that the ones at the MET retain their copyright notice boolean and Dawn asked that I keep advanced mode on. Advanced mode has been disabled on the MET machines. Other than that it was pretty obvious that the Bookeye 4's do work immensely better.</p>
