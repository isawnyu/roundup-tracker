Hi Michael,
This morning I swapped out the CPU at Zhiying's station with the other labeling station PC.  She is now able to login and access the application we use for labeling.  However, the driver for the printer is not installed on the new machine and I am not able to find a driver file to download on the LexMark site.  Help!
Thanks,
Dawn
