<p><span>Currently our Old Europe exhibition site located here:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/oldeurope/" target="_blank">http://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/oldeurope/</a><span>&nbsp;and hosted at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://isaw4.atlantides.org/" target="_blank">isaw4.atlantides.org</a><span>&nbsp;(66.35.39.43) needs access to the mysql host located on&nbsp;</span><a href="http://webdb.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">webdb.nyu.edu</a><span>.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current user is isaw_u<br />The current database is isaw<br /><br />We'd just like a GRANT so that&nbsp;<a href="http://isaw4.atlantides.org/" target="_blank">isaw4.atlantides.org</a>&nbsp;will be able to access the mysql instance on&nbsp;<a href="http://webdb.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">webdb.nyu.edu<br /><br /></a>Thanks!</p>
