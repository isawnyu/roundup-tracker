Hi Mike,

Could you please get/build shelves for the cabinets above the counters in the first floor kitchen? The storage space is badly needed; at the moment dishes can only be stored on the bottom of each cabinet.

Also, two of the light fixtures have lightbulbs which have burned out.  Could you please change the lightbulbs as soon as possible? People will be in that kitchen more often as we try to make it a more functional storage space for the basement and second floor kitchens.

Thanks,
Whitney
