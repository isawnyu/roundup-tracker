<p>This is in relation to <a href="issue1699">http://ticket.isaw.nyu.edu/help/issue1699</a>&nbsp;Although&nbsp;I'm not going to get to this anytime soon unless it becomes a critical issue we need to add some zeoclients to pipsqueak and automaton for some redundancy of isaw.nyu.edu. I'm not sure why Varnish is having read problems on the front page image. It could be an underlying filesystem problem or just zeoserver blobstorage inconsistency. The logs show me 200's so i'll have to spend sometime diagnosing should it be more of an issue. I'd truly hate to have to invest any large amount of time into this one so hopefully it's a minor hiccup somewhere.</p>
<p>We may need to update Plone soon as well, but I'd like to hold out until late summer 2012 for that.</p>
