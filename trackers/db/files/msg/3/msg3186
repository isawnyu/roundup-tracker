Christopher:

Please arrange with Chuck to loan him a loaner laptop that's been set up for Skype on one of the ISAW skype accounts. This is for cabinet meeting on Wednesday of this week, which will be our first attempt to have Roger, myself and Jennifer all skype in from other locations. 

Please make sure that both the system volume and skype volume are set high, and preload the following accounts into the NYU skype account contact list, if they're not already there:

paregorios (me)
rogerbagnall
jenniferyhchi

Thanks!
