<p style="text-align: left;">I've emailed Stephen Krause at NYU purchasing in an effort to find out whether there's an established route for leasing a couple of 27" iMacs. That way we can get costings on that (and on purchase) as a backup plan in case there's no reply on the software rescale need in the next day or so. Tom</p>
