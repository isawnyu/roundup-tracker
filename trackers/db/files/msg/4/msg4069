We are planning to upgrade Parallels to 6.0 and Windows to 7.0 on the following machines:

* Diane
* Whitney
* Irene
* Tom
* IT assistant
* Tiffany's new computer

The parallels licenses have arrived and are in Ben's possession. 

The Windows 7 media kit and licenses are on order through the NYU computer store (via iBuy) as of 4/1/11.

Once all the software has arrived, we'll want Ben to schedule the installs with individuals as appropriate. Tom will do his own install, but will need to be shipped the appropriate material (or just wait till he comes to NYC in May).
