<p><em>Nico via email:&nbsp;Hi Chris! How are you?</em><br /><em>I just read the messages you sent out about the station. The plan is</em><br /><em>that I move to an office on the fourth floor at the end of the Summer.</em><br /><em>I am currently out of the country and will be back the last week of</em><br /><em>August, so it won't be possible for me to move my things out of 603</em><br /><em>before then (I originally asked if I should pack my things before the</em><br /><em>Summer, but I was told it was fine to leave them in 603 until the end</em><br /><em>of the Summer, when the office switch would happen). I suppose we</em><br /><em>should probably wait until the end of August to set the station in</em><br /><em>603? (However, I have no problem if you need to put boxes containing</em><br /><em>the equipment in the office in the meantime).</em><br /><em>Ciao,</em><br /><em>Nicola</em></p>
<p>Right I would at the very least like to order the equipment.. The problem is that if I don't manage this I will be installing equipment that hasn't been tested and realistically this is turning into the summer of installs.</p>
<div>I'm sure I don't have to explain to you how a simple install can turn into a week or two long battle, so the earlier I get on-top of this the better.</div>
