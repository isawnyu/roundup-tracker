Dear Michael,

On January 20th the musicians that are performing here on January 22nd will have a rehearsal in the Lecture Hall from 6-8 PM. They are bringing all their own equipment which includes a full keyboard & stand, 2 or 3 medium speakers, 2-3 music stands, 2 microphones and 2 microphone stands. From my understanding we will be able to just plug everything into the electrical sockets in the floor. However any suggestions or advice would be appreciated.  I hope it is ok that I will be creating another IT ticket on January 21 with all the details for the concert on the 22nd. 

As always please call me if you would like to review in person.

Thanks,
Irene
