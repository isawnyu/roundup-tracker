<p>Just updated this to list 7 items and ascending order of events. Next thing to fix is the formatting which is a more complex issue. We are looking at close to 3-5 days of my time at ISAW or some such, the problem involves the description field and the stripping of it. I may have to add a new field to the content type and then migrate existing event content types that have the description populated to the new field, and obviously rewrite some code here to auto populate description on save; based on said new field.. Something like this.</p>
