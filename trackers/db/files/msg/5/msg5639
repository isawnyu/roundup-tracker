<p>Users who have expressed an interest include: Nico, Lorenzo. I'm putting out a survey today to find out more. Meanwhile, here's the latest in my communications with software licensing about this matter (sent to Scott Jackson, the licensing guy on 8/31; includes earlier traffic in quotes):</p>
<p>Hi Scott: <br /> <br />Sorry to be slow in following this up ... some crazy summer stuff went down. <br /> <br />We have less than 10 (right now 2-4) faculty and visiting/senior scholars who would like to be able to use AUTOCAD on an ad hoc basis from time-to-time (for archaeological projects). I'm gathering more information about their specific needs, but I don't think any of them would be looking at using it regularly on anything like a 9-5 m-f basis; it would be much more episodic than that. The costs of standalone licenses for each of them are pretty much prohibitive as it stands now. <br /> <br />I can think of a few solutions: <br /> <br />1. a single workstation at ISAW running AUTOCAD on a standalone license. Significant downsides are the bottleneck caused by serializing use and the inability to work in the field or on the machine where one has all one's data. <br /> <br />2. several floating licenses based on an estimate of frequency of use (though I suspect the vendor won't go for this) <br /> <br />3. while I'm fantasizing: a vendor sponsorship in which we get AUTOCAD for free in return for some kind of product name placement in publications or on our web site <br /> <br />4. a license server (ideally run by someone other than us -- ITS? -- and providing off-campus connections) holding a couple of concurrent network licenses so ISAW users can just pop on and do what they want to do (so long as their colleagues haven't maxed out the concurrent quota at any particular moment). This solution might eventually scale to include some other kinds of software (e.g., ESRI ArcGIS). <br /> <br />Can you think of any other options? Do you think any of the above would be viable? <br /> <br />Thanks, <br />Tom <br /> </p>
